The journal does not impose an embargo period on the redistribution of material.

# Plagiarism

The editors of _British Art Studies_ use the plagiarism detection software Similarity Check to verify the originality of submissions to the journal. Peer reviewers are also asked to consider whether the author of a submission has plagiarised another publication or published the research before.

Plagiarism is understood by the editors as failing to acknowledge the work or contributions of other people. This can include reusing material and paraphrasing material without appropriate citation.

Following the [guidelines](https://publicationethics.org/files/A_Short_Guide_to_Ethical_Editing.pdf) of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), authors will also be expected to retain documentation for any citations to unpublished work, such as personal communications.

In many cases, copyright or other proprietary rights for material published in British Art Studies may be held by individuals or entities other than, or in addition to, the authors or the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art. Where materials (text or image-based) published in the journal are still protected by copyright, the author must cite the relevant copyright information when reproducing it and comply with all other terms or restrictions that may be applicable to that material. Our in-house Picture Researcher is often able to assist with obtaining the relevant permissions.
