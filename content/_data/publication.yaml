    affiliation:  Wesleyan University
    bio: "Jennifer Tucker is a historian of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century British society, who specializes in the study of the visual worlds of photographic and cinematic evidence, especially in the fields of science, law, forensic medicine, news reporting, courtroom trials, and the environment. Her recent publications include an article about work and waste in the Victorian alkali industry, published in the *International Labor and Working-Class History* journal; an interview with historian David Serlin about museums and public history during COVID-19 in “Guns, Germs, and Public History”, is published in the *Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences* (July 2021); a roundtable discussion about *Ambivalent: Photography and Visibility in African History* in *The American Historical Review* (December 2021); and a theme issue of *Radical History Review* on “Visual Archives of Sex” (January 2022), which she co-edited. Her current research traces the historical roots of the use of visual evidence in environmental science and pollution reform, and explores the visual representation in chemical climatology and the presentation of visual exhibits in Victorian courtroom debates over air and river pollution. She teaches in the History Department and Science in Society Program at Wesleyan University, and lives in New Haven, Connecticut."

Barrett performs composites of plants, animals, elements, and people to create interventions that present their objectification and commodification; she also thinks about how to change perceptions of phenomena in “nature” that are a given. The work seeks to create new questions where there was a kind of certainty that has to do with the hegemony of normative Western European values.\nBorn in the UK of Jamaican and German parentage, Sonia E. Barrett grew up in Hong Kong, Zimbabwe, Cyprus, and the UK. She studied Literature at the University of St Andrews Scotland and her MFA at Transart Institute Berlin/New York. Her work unpacks the boundaries between the determined and the determining with a focus on race and gender. She makes sculptural works so she can run her hands along the fissures and manifest strategies for multiple compatible existences and mourn. Her sculptural practice includes place-making with a view to assembling communities under the threat of climate change to (Re-)claim space as well as instituting permanently. Sonia is a MacDowell fellow and has been recognised by the Premio Ora prize, NY Art-Slant showcase for sculpture, and the Neo Art Prize.

Currently, she is working on her practice-based PhD research project: *Plastic Fantasies: Reconfigure Subjectivity As Embodied Avatars*, at the University of Brighton. How to construct subjectivity on the threshold of becoming? Ada's performances deterritorialise viewers with a non-dualistic reconfiguration among embodied subjects and alienated individuals by reimagining and resituating the embodied experience of “becoming” as a radical performance-based method that disrupts the existing knowledge of post-human subjectivity. As a curator in performance, Ada runs PAPRIKA Collective with such questions as: would it be possible for one to make an analogy between a site-specific performance space and a scientific lab? If possible, can we use any site-specific performance space as an inhabitant to purposely situate “becoming”? Most recently, Ada has presented the one-year project *NAUT-ADA (2019)* at the “Fiction as Method” symposium at Bath University.

His first book, *Painters and Public Life in Eighteenth-Century Paris*, was quickly recognized as providing a fresh model for understanding the art and larger culture of its period. At the same moment, his much-reprinted essay, 'Modernism and Mass Culture in the Visual Arts', identified interdependency rather than antagonism between modern fine art and popular visual expression. All of these concerns—the broad social history of artistic form and reassessing cultural hierarchies alongside the individual formations of artists—came together in his recent, warmly received *Long March of Pop: Art, Music, and Design 1930-1995*. His doctoral degree is from UCLA, and he holds honorary doctorates from Pomona College and the Courtauld Institute. Before coming to the Institute of Fine Arts, his appointments included Chairs at the University of Sussex and at Yale University, as well as the Directorship of the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles. He has also been for twenty years an active contributing editor at *Artforum*.

As chief curator of the Museums of Contemporary Art in Chicago and Los Angeles, she staged some of the first US shows of American and European artists. Then, shifting her workplace from the museum to the street, she critically engaged the discourse around public space with such landmark site-specific and community based programmes as *Culture in Action* in Chicago, *Conversations at The Castle* during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and *Places with a Past* for the Spoleto Festival USA, which catalyzed two decades of community engagement in Charleston, South Carolina. At the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Jacob launched Sullivan Galleries, located in the famed Louis Sullivan building in Chicago’s Loop, in 2008; then in 2016 she established the Institute for Curatorial Research and Practice, which she directs, to further the creative processes undertaken by curators and foster advanced thinking in the field. Artists’ relation to audiences and their work within the wider realm of society have been the subject of Jacob’s co-edited volumes, *Buddha Mind in Contemporary Art* (2004), *Learning Mind: Experience into Art* (2010), *Chicago Makes Modern: How Creative Minds Changed Society* (2013), *The Studio Reader: On the Space of Artists* (2010), and the *Chicago Social Practice History* *Series*."

His doctoral thesis examined afresh the connotations between confessional identity and architectural display in early modern England. In his subsequent role as one of two post-doctoral researchers attached to the AHRC-funded Saint Stephen's Chapel, Westminster: Visual and Political Culture, 1292–1941, he considered and examined how visual associations between Parliament as an institution and its architectural locus were projected into the political events of the seventeenth century. James also guided the virtual reconstruction of the House of Commons chamber, as extant in 1707. Following this, he pursued an interest in the later history of the Palace of Westminster by cataloguing over 500 drawings in the collection of the Sir John Soane's Museum. One part of the Religion and the Law project, jointly funded by the Worshipful Company of Mercers and the Pilgrim Trust, this work focused upon the New Law Courts designed by Soane in the 1820s. James is currently working in the Archives of the Norman Foster Foundation, Madrid."

Her scholarship is interdisciplinary and comparative in approach, crossing the bounds of British, American, Asian, and Latin American studies. Primary fields of research include: transatlantic/transpacific exchanges; science and race; material culture and globalism; contemporary/postcolonial art, film, and visual culture. Her book, *Performing China: Virtue, Commerce, and Orientalism in Eighteenth-century England, 1660-1760* (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2011), is a study of the European fascination with Asia. It examines how China became an intensely debated example of virtue amidst England’s new consumer culture. Her new work concerns race, chinoiserie, transatlantic slavery, and the cultural impact of global flows of silver between Latin America and East Asia."

Her current research addresses the conjunction of artistic and industrial materials and methods in the decades before the Great Exhibition of 1851. This proposed talk draws upon research for this project, as she positions Constable, Lucas and their fraught collaboration on *English Landscap* in relationship to the use of steel plates and contemporary debates about the industrialisation of printmaking."
