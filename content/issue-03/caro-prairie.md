# Prologue: Out of Sight

{% assign DOI = "p1" %}

*Prairie*, a modern masterwork of painted steel by Sir Anthony Caro (1924--2013), has crossed the Atlantic no fewer than eight times since its making in London in 1967 ([fig. 1](#figure1)). The international life of *Prairie* is extensive, especially considering the serious logistics involved in disassembling, shipping, and installing a sculpture that measures 38 x 229 x 126 inches (96.5 x 582 x 320 cm):

*Prairie* did not, however, make the trip for the 2015 double down of Caro survey exhibitions jointly organized by The Hepworth Wakefield and the Yorkshire Sculpture Park (YSP).[^1] Titled *Caro in Yorkshire*, the aim of these complementary exhibitions was to celebrate and commemorate the career of Caro with a showing of notable works such as *Twenty Four Hours* (1960), *Sculpture Seven* (1961), *Month of May* (1963), and *Promenade* (1996), to name a few. Adrian Searle of *The Guardian* called the exhibition "Larger and more comprehensive even than the Tate Britain Caro retrospective of 2005", and yet *Prairie* was conspicuously missing from this robust reunion.[^2] Also obvious was the fact that an exhibition of Henry Moore's work held the place of pride in the YSP's main gallery at the time of this important survey of Caro's work.[^3] Instead, Caro's work could be found dwarfed throughout the YSP's rolling fields and at the Park's Longside Gallery, roughly two kilometres out from the YSP Centre. At The Hepworth Wakefield, Caro was deftly inserted within the canon of great British sculptors of the twentieth century as the exhibition there was indirectly framed within the superb permanent collection.

{% assign DOI = "p3" %}

The myopic selection of works for the exhibitions held in Yorkshire in 2015, suggests that the best of Caro from the point of view of the UK is different than the best of Caro from an American point of view. Caro in the UK is a crescendo after the major movement of Moore. Caro in America struck an all-new chord. In 2007, Caro recalled his close American connections, and the freedom of disconnection abroad: 

> When I went to America the excitement in New York was in painting not in sculpture. When I went to Bennington, my friends and neighbours were painters Olitski and Noland. At weekends, Noland would have people to stay, critics, and painters. I cannot think of a single sculptor. For me it was very interesting. I could almost divorce myself from the history of sculpture.[^4]

{% assign DOI = "p4" %}

His relations with David Smith are curiously missing in the above statement. This erasure implies that his "almost divorce" from the history of sculpture may not have been just a matter of new contexts (geographic and social) but actually a conscious decision of the artist who revelled in the disassociation from notions of patrimony in sculpture.

{% assign DOI = "p5" %}

Was *Prairie* not included in the survey mounted by YSP and The Hepworth Wakefield because, to the British eye, it appears to be an outlier? Caro felt that *Prairie* was his most successfully abstract sculpture ever.[^5] Referring to nothing outside of itself, *Prairie* does not serve to demonstrate the patrimony of British sculpture. Even the title feels American, although it is a misnomer: not, in fact, referring to low-lying fields of golden crops, but actually pointing to the commercial name for the paint colour "Prairie Gold" that the artist had intended to use (though ultimately did not) after first painting the sculpture blue ([fig. 3](#figure3)).[^6]

{% assign DOI = "p6" %}

While a relatively limited number of people had the opportunity to see *Prairie*'s inaugural display in 1967 at Kasmin Gallery in London, a wide American audience for *Prairie* was cultivated just months later, in 1968, by the championing words of Michael Fried that landed the sculpture on the cover of *Artforum* ([fig. 4](#figure4)).

# The Eye's Mind: *Prairie* and Michael Fried

{% assign DOI = "p7" %}

The American art critic and art historian Michael Fried first met Caro in 1961 in Hampstead, London.[^7] There, in the artist's courtyard, Fried had an epiphany of sorts, claiming to have seen two of the most groundbreaking abstract sculptures he had ever seen: *Midday* (1960) and *Sculpture Seven* (1961).[^8] Six years later, Fried would again be impressed by the progressive abstraction of two more Caro sculptures. After seeing Caro's *Deep Body Blue* (1967) and *Prairie* at Kasmin Gallery, Fried wrote a compelling (and now oft-cited) review titled "Two Sculptures by Anthony Caro" for *Artforum*'s February 1968 issue ([figs. 6--10](#figure6)).[^9] Both sculptures were displayed in one room, but *Prairie* caught Fried's eye most of all:

> More explicitly than any previous sculpture, *Prairie* compels us to believe what we see rather than what we know, to accept the witness of the senses against the constructions of the mind.[^10]

{% assign DOI = "p8" %}

Fried's review put *Prairie* on the map in America, bolstered by the fact that it made the cover of *Artforum*, making it the top model for abstract sculpture in the US, despite its English birth. Following the popular review in *Artforum*, Caro wrote two letters to Fried (29 February and 24 March 1968):

> I am delighted that the sculptures meant so much to you---your description of *Prairie* is the first accurate one . . . except that, believe it or not---thanks to Charlie (Hendy)!---the poles are steel . . . The way you saw just exactly what the upright rectangle that supported the pole in *Prairie* was doing, and it gives me a real thrill of pleasure to have my work so accurately grasped.[^11]

Fried's review had not pointed to the lineage of sculpture that came before *Prairie*. Instead, he pointed to philosophy and even briefly to architecture when describing the 1967 work by Caro. Fried celebrated *Prairie*'s "extraordinary marriage of illusion and structural obviousness", feeling no need to add significance to the work by weaving it within a history of sculpture and influences.[^12] Fried cast a purely American eye (or a purifying American eye) upon *Prairie* that allowed for a new generation of painters and sculptors to accept it as their own new way forward. It is fitting that a steel sculpture praised for its defiance of gravity would grant a certain amount of levity to young sculptors who were encouraged to feel unburdened by the history of building and shaping mass in their sculptures.

{% assign DOI = "p9" %}

In the spring of 1967, Caro would publicly protest against the Tate's proposal to permanently display (by facilitation of public funds) a large gift of Henry Moore's work. Along with about forty other British artists, Caro signed an open letter to the *Times* to declare, among other firm points, that:

> Whoever is picked out for this exceptional place will necessarily seem to represent the triumph of modern art in our society. The radical nature of art in the twentieth century is inconsistent with the notion of an heroic and monumental role for the artist and any attempt to predetermine greatness for an individual in a publicly financed form of permanent enshrinement is a move we as artists repudiate.[^13]

Ultimately, Moore made a major gift of original plasters to the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) in Toronto, which built a permanent gallery with Moore's input on the architecture of the purpose-built space.

# *Prairie* in the USA

{% assign DOI = "p10" %}

Caro had expressed his enthusiasm for *Prairie* to Lewis Cabot, a Boston-based connoisseur of Modernist art who would become a longtime supporter of Caro.[^14] Remaining in the United States, Cabot purchased *Prairie* sight unseen from its 1967 London debut at Kasmin Gallery.[^15] Cabot made the purchase with the understanding that he was building a careful repository of works by Caro, and waited several years before shipping *Prairie* to his own storage in the US. Before taking physical possession of the sculpture, Cabot lent *Prairie* to important exhibitions, including the X Bienal de Sao Paulo and London's Hayward Gallery in 1969.

{% assign DOI = "p11" %}

By 1975, when *Prairie* was shown in the artist's first American retrospective, which toured widely,[^16] *Prairie* had changed hands to the collection of Lois and Georges de Menil, who were also based in the USA.[^17] In 1977, the de Menils placed *Prairie* on long-term loan with the National Gallery of Art (NGA) in Washington, DC, where it resides today (figs. [12](#figure12), [15](#figure15), [16](#figure16)) The accession file on the sculpture and its history in the custody of the NGA is chock-full of firm letters from the de Menils, who consistently, and successfully, argue for the near-constant public display of *Prairie* at the gallery.[^18] While in the custody of the NGA, *Prairie* has continued to be shown far and wide, including Rome in 1992, Tokyo in 1995, and back to its birthplace in London, for Tate Britain's Caro retrospective in 2005. It is notable that *Prairie* was included in Tate's Caro retrospective but not in the most recent in-depth survey in Yorkshire. Posthumous large-scale exhibitions are, of course, quite a different thing from a major show during an artist's lifetime---when curators and museums must respect what the artist points to as being important. After death, alternate stories are much easier to articulate.

# After *Prairie*: Kenneth Noland and *Cadence*

{% assign DOI = "p12" %}

*Prairie* caught the eye of the American painter Kenneth Noland (1924--2010). His admiration of *Prairie* evolved into asking Caro to make something like *Prairie* for him--- and *Cadence* (1968/72) was born ([fig. 13](#figure13)).[^19]

{% assign DOI = "p13" %}

If not looking too hard, *Cadence* might be understood as an icon, serving to harken back thoughts of *Prairie*, yet held in equal reverie by onlookers. In 1967, Rosalind Krauss issued some critical pushback that could have served as a preemptive strike to anyone claiming to see *Cadence* as pale by comparison:

> It has become a reflex action, a kind of literary tic, of current formalist art writing to consider a given work or a given juncture in an artist's style only from the point of view of a progression.[^20]

{% assign DOI = "p14" %}

Caro was close to the best formalist writers but certainly did not think twice about looking back in his work. Fried called *Prairie* "a touchstone for future sculpture", lending it a superlative power that might have made other artists freeze up with the pressure of having reached a high watermark.[^21] Caro recalled:

> I hoped at the time I made \[*Prairie*\] that I would be able to go even more abstract. But in the end I wanted to put something of the real world in my sculptures. Indeed, since *Prairie*, all my sculptures have a part that is directly linked to the world around.[^22]

The link that *Cadence* made to the world was to point back at *Prairie*. By definition, "cadence" may refer to a slight change or inflection in one's voice, or expression. *Cadence* is a variation on *Prairie*. It was also made with Noland in mind ([fig. 14](#figure14)). *Cadence* remained in Noland's possession for the rest of his life and now resides in a private collection in Canada.

# The View

{% assign DOI = "p15" %}

As addressed at the outset of this article, the exhibition *Caro in Yorkshire*, shared between the YSP and The Hepworth Wakefield in 2015, nestled the artist firmly within a British context. In the midst of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, *Prairie* holds court with a variety of masterful works of art from around the world (fig. 15). In the context of the NGA, *Prairie* is seen as a triumphant Modernist sculpture---displayed without narrative, but simply in conversation with other select works of art. If it were displayed at the National Gallery, London, would it be framed as a chapter within a wider history of sculpture?

{% assign DOI = "p16" %}

Reviewing the photographs throughout this essay, it is apparent that *Prairie* looks different from every angle. The viewer has a similar experience in "walking" this sculpture (fig. 16). Round and round, and round again, *Prairie* takes up one's entire field of vision at one moment and then effortlessly slips away with virtually no sense of mass from another view. For now, photographs will have to suffice, as *Prairie* has just come off display at the NGA. A "Caro in America" show may be due, or even overdue, lest *Prairie* remains sight unseen.
