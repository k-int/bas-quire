abstract: "This Cover Collaboration seeks to convey the atmospheric materiality of the studio-home of Frederic Leighton in the Holland Park area of West London. Five short films made by Jonathan Law highlight particular features of Leighton House, includingÂ the tiles of the Arab Hall imported from Turkey and the Middle East, the glittering golden chandelier, the sonorous tinkle of the fountain, and the peacock-inspired colours and textures of the interior design. The films are accompanied by texts chosen by Mary Roberts, author of an article on \"The Resistant Materiality of Frederic Leighton's Arab Hall\" in this issue of *British Art Studies*."
acknowledgements: "All five films were made for Issue 9 of *British Art Studies* by Jonathan Law at Leighton House Museum. Many thanks to Daniel Robins and Sam Butler at Leighton House for their kind assistance."
