# IV. Contrapuntal Pedagogies

The records gathered here, including curricula, artists' notes, and administrative and artistic correspondence, enable us to consider how a number of overseas artists who passed through the Slade reworked, supplemented, and often disrupted the school's pedagogical models in contrapuntal fashions. Transversal comparisons of three groups of pedagogical artefacts from three different sites---Dhaka, Lahore, and the Sinophone world---provide a means of analysing critical appropriations of the Slade's curriculum in order to draw relational comparisons between different colonial and postcolonial histories of art education.
