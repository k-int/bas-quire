# III. Contrapuntal World-Making

This section focuses on the work of art in the context of the contrapuntal worlds made and remade by overseas artists at the Slade, reflecting their negotiation of novel configurations of artistic methods, vocabularies, and schemas. The five artists featured---Zainul Abedin (1951--1952), Tseng Yu (1952--1956), Wendy Yeo (1953; 1955--1959), Anwar Jalal Shemza (1956--1960), and Kim Lim (1957--1960; 1969--1970)---each came to the Slade via different circuits of mobility and access, and each responded in turn to the opportunities and challenges of the Slade as a contact zone, producing distinct contrapuntal aesthetics. When examined together with the Slade as a transversal line, the relationships between these works become more evident, bringing out their harmonic interdependencies despite their independent melodic lines.
