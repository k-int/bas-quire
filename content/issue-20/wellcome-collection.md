abstract: "In these three short films, Ludmilla Jordanova and William Schupbach discuss the production, use, and circulation of a range of anatomical images and texts from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in the Wellcome Collection. With a focus on works by Joseph Maclise and his predecessors, the discussants consider the aesthetic, scientific, and philosophical contexts in which anatomists and artists made images of the inside of the human body. They also discuss the professional networks involved in the production of William Hunter's *The Anatomy of the Human Gravid Uterus*, Richard Quain's *The Anatomy of the Arteries of the Human Body*, Maclise's *Surgical Anatomy*, among others*.* By turning pages, examining binding, deciphering inscriptions, and comparing editions, Jordanova and Schupbach engage with the materiality of the atlases, reminding us that they functioned as both working objects and collectors' items."
