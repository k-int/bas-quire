                      <div class="abstract-text">
                        In the competitive environment of the eighteenth-century
                        London art scene, Thomas Gainsborough and Sir Joshua
                        Reynolds were often perceived as great rivals. While
                        they shared patrons, sitters, and a stake in the future
                        of British art, their differing artistic approaches
                        caused considerable friction, indeed Gainsborough
                        seceded from the Royal Academy of Art in 1784,
                        boycotting its exhibitions and activities. This essay,
                        however, argues that Gainsborough’s* Charity Relieving
                        Distress*, painted in the year of his secession,
                        proposes a charitable resolution of their aesthetic
                        attitudes. The complex interrelation of allegorical and
                        anecdotal form is interpreted as a pictorial attempt to
                        reconcile their approaches through the concept of
                        charity, a virtue of powerful artistic lineage in the
                        western tradition, and of contemporary social
                        importance*.

                      <div class="abstract-text">
                        At the end of the Second World War, the Hungarian-Jewish
                        painter Magda Cordell McHale fled to London, where she
                        remained until 1961, when she moved to the United States
                        to pursue a career in futurology with her husband, the
                        artist John McHale (d. 1978). The decade or so she spent
                        in London was the most prolific phase in her artistic
                        career. It saw her involved in the foundation of the
                        Independent Group (1952–55), and exhibiting at the
                        Institute of Contemporary Arts and the Hanover Gallery.
                        Although Cordell was widely recognized for her
                        ambivalent portrayals of the female body as mythic
                        archetype and techno-scientific testing ground, she has
                        not received due acknowledgment in the recent literature
                        on postwar Britain and the Independent Group. This
                        article re-evaluates the legacy of her proto-feminist
                        artworks, arguing for Cordell’s important contribution
                        to postwar British art and culture.

                        Can there be such a thing as “Arts and Crafts” painting?
                        This article will address that question by interrogating
                        the points of connection between Pre-Raphaelite painting
                        and the Arts and Crafts object. Taking its cue from
                        William Morris’s reflection on the “English
                        Pre-Raphaelite School” from 1891, this article examines
                        the interplay between painting and design in both
                        Pre-Raphaelite painting and the Arts and Crafts
                        movement. It addresses the ways in which paintings
                        depicted decorative art, as well as the aspiration of
                        decorative art to the symbolic potential traditionally
                        associated with painting. It is my contention that
                        Pre-Raphaelite painting unleashed a radical possibility
                        for decorative art: the Arts and Crafts belief in the
                        political agency of things.

                        that is pre-eminently visual and necessarily
                        collaborative, and that is made possible by the digital

                        1960s. The films ask you, firstly, to look closely at
                        the images being discussed. Each one begins with a
                        sustained and intense shot of a single image before

                      <div class="abstract-text">
                        This article examines the protean nature of ingegno in
                        Renaissance England. Beginning with dictionary
                        definitions and period translations, it traces the
                        semantics of ingegno in writings by Haydocke, Hilliard,
                        Sidney, Harington, and Dee, and in images by Gheeraerts
                        the elder and Hilliard. The term’s semantic elasticity
                        carried over into English, changing shape to denote
                        variously “wit”, “inborn talent”, “sharpness”,
                        “swiftness”, “nobility”, “freedom”, and “ingenuity”. The
                        article concludes by considering the socio-economics of
                        ingenuity, and how the slippage between “ingenious” and
                        “ingenuous” speaks to a newly emerging understanding of
                        the liberal status of the artist and his craft.

                        Frederick H. Evans (1853–1943) spent the turn of the
                        twentieth century photographing English and French
                        cathedrals, always using the church to figure a
                        particularly late Victorian alarm at the lost vitality
                        these medieval structures symbolized. This article
                        illuminates his art’s deep religious stakes by exploring
                        the mystical resonances of his stated preference for the
                        lantern slide as a support for his images, a matter that
                        has been long overlooked despite his extensive articles
                        on the topic.&nbsp;Evans’s cathedral photographs are
                        most fully comprehended when his promotion of glass over
                        paper is acknowledged and interpreted through his
                        affiliation to Swedenborgianism.

                      <div class="abstract-text">
                        This article’s aims are twofold: firstly, it argues that
                        Prunella Clough’s engagement with consumer items in her
                        paintings of the 1980s and 1990s constitute a sustained
                        engagement with the fluctuating nature of the commodity
                        form, moving beyond the established critical narrative
                        whereby these works are understood as simply redeeming
                        “everyday” materials. Secondly, in order to do this, it
                        proposes new artistic frameworks for Clough’s work,
                        moving away from her early association with
                        Neo-Romanticism to foreground her relationship with Pop
                        and Minimalism, and with Post-Conceptual painting.
                        Clough’s late works, it finds, powerfully condense
                        histories of industrial production and painting in
                        Britain.

                        The cover of the first issue of British Art Studies
                        plays with the conventions of the traditional cover of a
                        journal or magazine. A cover traditionally has various
                        functions: to illustrate or give a glimpse into the
                        contents; to protect the pages sandwiched in between;
                        and, occasionally, to conceal rather than advertise what
                        is inside. The digital format of British Art Studies has
                        allowed us to rethink what a cover is and what it can
                        do. We have created more than simply a landing page for
                        presenting text and practical information and made a
                        feature worth visiting in its own right. The cover
                        images selected for issue one do not illustrate any of
                        the articles, but generate a stand-alone feature. For
                        the first issue, we have collaborated with British Art
                        Show 8 (BAS 8) to make a cover that does not simply
                        point to the content within but also connects outwards.
                        Featuring new works by eight artists, who are all
                        participating in BAS 8, the cover is never static and a
                        fresh image will load each time you return to the
                        journal. In this text, Roger Malbert, Head of Hayward
                        Touring (the organization responsible for the British
                        Art Show) reflects on the idea and history of the show.
                        Exhibitions’ histories have been a focus of research
                        activity at the Paul Mellon Centre and the Yale Center
                        for British Art recently through events such as a joint
                        session at the Association of Art Historians conference
                        in 2015, and a forthcoming conference in collaboration
                        with Tate Britain on exhibitions of contemporary art in
                        Britain between 1945 and 1960. This collaboration with
                        British Art Show 8 extends this conversation to consider
                        the implications of exhibiting the contemporary under

                  <em>British Art Studies</em> is the joint publication of two
                  research centres dedicated to British art: the Paul Mellon
                  Centre for Studies in British Art (PMC), London, and the Yale
                  Center for British Art (YCBA), New Haven. The journal has
                  grown out of many conversations and collaborations between the
                  two centres, working with scholars and institutions worldwide.
                  The foremost aim of
                  <em>British Art Studies</em> (<em>BAS</em>) is to provide a
                  platform for innovative thinking, debate, and dialogue about
                  British art, an area of research that, as our first issue
                  makes clear, is constantly changing, expanding, and being
                  re-defined. Through <em>BAS</em> we want to encourage and
                  share a multitude of approaches, voices, and objects.

                <h1 id="born-digital" tabindex="-1">Born digital</h1>
                <p>
                  <em>British Art Studies</em> is a “digital first” publication,
                  meaning that it has no printed counterpart and is designed
                  primarily to be read on screen (although all content can be
                  downloaded or read offline). Many people now read on the move,
                  using various devices. The “pages” of
                  <em>BAS</em> responsively adapt to the size and orientation of
                  the device, whether a computer, tablet, or smartphone.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From the very beginning, the guiding principle for developing
                  <em>BAS</em> has been to ask what could be done with a digital
                  journal that could not be done in print. This starts with
                  our&nbsp;<a href="#https-doi-org-10-17658-issn-2058-5462-issue-01" target="_blank">cover</a>
                  where we have moved away from the convention of using a single
                  image. Of course, a digital publication does not need a cover
                  in the traditional sense; but we wanted to develop a feature
                  that offers content, as well as a compelling visual threshold
                  at which to pause before delving into the journal. For our
                  first issue we have worked with the artists and curators of
                  <a href="#http-britishartshow8-com" target="_blank"><em>British Art Show 8</em></a>
                  to create a dynamic set of covers, featuring eight works and a
                  "<a href="#https-doi-org-10-17658-issn-2058-5462-issue-01-rmalbert" target="_blank">Cover Collaboration"</a>

                  Although emerging out of the research cultures of our two
                  centres, <em>BAS</em> uses the digital to reach beyond the
                  physical walls of our buildings in London and New Haven.
                  Articles are chosen through an open call for submissions and,
                  as our first issue shows, address a diverse range of topics,
                  periods, and approaches. The second issue of
                  <em>British Art Studies</em> will appear in spring 2016, and
                  will be followed by a special issue in summer 2016 on “British
                  Sculpture Abroad, 1945–2000”. This will also be our future
                  publication pattern—two open and one special issue each
                  year—allowing us to remain responsive and engaged with the
                  very best and most exciting scholarship in the field.

                  <em>BAS</em> offers new models for digital publishing. As well
                  as single-author articles, it includes interactive features
                  that foster dialogue, discussion, and the participation of
                  many voices—including those of readers. Our first
                  <a href="#https-doi-org-10-17658-issn-2058-5462-issue-01-conversation" target="_blank">Conversation Piece</a>, led by Richard Johns, solicits responses from academics,
                  curators, and artists to the provocation “There’s no such
                  thing as British art.” Through text, film, and visual work,
                  this conversation opens up arguments with and approaches to
                  the field we call “British art”. The&nbsp;<a href="#https-doi-org-10-17658-issn-2058-5462-issue-01-conversation" target="_blank">Conversation Piece</a>
                  will build cumulatively over the coming weeks. The first wave
                  of the launch presents four responses; more will be added in
                  the coming weeks. Readers can contribute too, using the
                  discussion board. Interactivity is offered throughout
                  <em>British Art Studies.</em> We actively encourage users to
                  share content using the “Share” button which appears on the
                  right-hand side of every article. We hope this will open the
                  conversation about British art and architecture even more
                  widely.

                  of open access is one that YCBA and PMC have adopted for all
                  their digital efforts, in the recognition that conventional
                  proprietary models represent a major obstacle to scholarship.

                  We hope that, in turn, <em>BAS</em> will provide a further
                  model for innovative solutions to the challenges presented by
                  online publishing: for example, that of how to capture
                  accurate citations from online content, given there are no
                  page numbers. <em>BAS</em> offers a more precise method than
                  copying and pasting a URL (more precise even than the paper
                  convention of page numbers). Every paragraph and figure is
                  attributed with a
                  <a href="#https-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-digital-object-identifier" target="_blank">DOI</a>—a digital object identifier—allowing users to cite exact
                  locations simply by clicking and copying the links provided by
                  the “DOI” buttons.

                  In 2014, the
                  <a href="#http-www-khist-uzh-ch-chairs-neuzeit-res-conf-zuerich14b-zurichdeclarationondigitalarthistory2014-pdf" target="_blank">Zurich Declaration on Digital Art History</a>
                  stated: “Digital change requires critical reflection about the
                  methods and practices of art history, such as the way pictures
                  are analysed and canons are formed. There should be a
                  productive two-way relationship between research questions and
                  digital applications.” Our goal is that <em>BAS</em> becomes
                  an incubator for such critical reflection, providing a space
                  for a digital art history which makes use of computational
                  technology and data, as well as a digitized art history that
                  makes scholarship widely—and freely—available online.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>

                  Over several years, both centres have led efforts to support
                  digital scholarship, by channelling resources into new outputs
                  and activities, while providing support and guidance to other
                  institutions. The PMC has transformed some of its standard
                  publication formats into digital-only platforms: the first,
                  <em><a href="#http-www-richardwilsononline-ac-uk" target="_blank">Richard Wilson Online</a></em>, appeared in 2014, and in early 2016, the Francis Towne
                  catalogue raisonné will appear online. The YCBA was a major
                  supporter of a Yale-wide effort to implement an
                  <a href="#http-ydc2-yale-edu-open-access-collections" target="_blank">open-access policy</a>. In 2011, all of the YCBA’s digital images of works in the
                  public domain were released and made freely and easily
                  available online, including for commercial purposes: there are
                  no forms to fill out, and no permissions to request or
                  restrictions on use. YCBA and PMC are also collaborating with
                  international consortia to develop online spaces for
                  scholarship. YCBA’s images are now also available as
                  <a href="#http-iiif-io" target="_blank">IIIF</a> assets,
                  meaning they meet an agreed international standard to enable
                  interoperability. The web-based open-source image viewer
                  <a href="#http-projectmirador-org-index-html" target="_blank">Mirador</a>
                  is being developed into an online space for collaborative
                  work, where scholars can effortlessly collect, compare,
                  manipulate, and share images from multiple institutions.
                  Similarly, YCBA has made its collections available as Linked
                  Open Data, which allows its information to harmonize with that
                  of other institutions, making it easier for users to find,
                  link, and build relationships between works of art.

                  All of the articles in <em>BAS</em> make use of the phenomenal
                  work carried out by public and private collections to make
                  their holdings available online. Seemingly instantaneous in
                  some cases, but in reality the product of Herculean efforts by
                  curatorial, imaging, technical, and conservation staff, images
                  of art works are becoming publicly available in
                  ever-increasing quantities.

                  We want this journal to offer a powerfully visual and
                  interactive experience. The abundance of large-scale images,
                  the clean design and the distinctive fonts (Tiempos Headline
                  and Aperçu), together with the inbuilt connectivity to other
                  websites and online resources, will, we hope, give
                  <em>British Art Studies</em> a unique look and create an
                  absorbing, stimulating, and exciting environment for our
                  users. The digital realm offers new ways of looking at and
                  engaging with images, the possibilities and pitfalls of which
                  are being extensively debated.

                  feature is offered as an experiment in using the medium of
                  film to explore images in new ways. The filmmaker Jonathan
                  Law, collaborating with James Boaden and Paul Rousseau, has
                  created an extraordinary series of films about the
                  double-exposure photographs by John Deakin. In our
                  <a href="#https-doi-org-10-17658-issn-2058-5462-issue-01-harwood" target="_blank">One Object</a>
                  feature, Cyra Levenson, Chi-ming Yang, and the artist Ken
                  Gonzales-Day, take a single work—a black limestone bust by the
                  eighteenth-century sculptor Francis Harwood— as a starting
                  point to think about materiality, portraiture, and race. As
                  Gonzales-Day’s photographic essay exemplifies, the digital
                  undoubtedly creates a new visuality—what might be described as
                  an aesthetics of the digital—which we will continue to explore
                  in future issues.

                  Making a digital journal from scratch involves a huge amount
                  of creative, intellectual, and physical work, as well as
                  financial investment. Like all of our activities, it has only
                  been possible to pursue this project thanks to the
                  extraordinary legacy of
                  <a href="#http-www-paul-mellon-centre-ac-uk-about-paul-mellon" target="_blank">Paul Mellon</a>
                  himself. The creation of <em>British Art Studies</em> has also
                  depended upon the support, expertise, and advice of our
                  colleagues, beginning with those at the PMC and the YCBA. Mark
                  Hallett, Director of Studies at the PMC, initiated the idea of
                  the journal in 2012, and together with Amy Meyers, Director of
                  the YCBA, formed an
                  <a href="#about-editorial-team">editorial team</a>. Headed by
                  Sarah Victoria Turner, the PMC’s Deputy Director for Research
                  and the Managing Editor of <em>BAS</em>, this team consists of
                  staff from both centres: Martina Droth (Deputy Director of
                  Research and Curator of Sculpture, YCBA); Martin Postle
                  (Deputy Director for Collections and Publications, PMC). Until
                  recently, it also included Eleanor Hughes (formerly YCBA and
                  now Deputy Director for Art and Program at the Walters Art
                  Museum, Baltimore).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Meanwhile, our international
                  <a href="#about-advisory-board">Advisory Board</a> has
                  supported this venture from the outset with generous amounts
                  of time and advice. We would also like to acknowledge the help
                  of Maisoon Rehani (PMC), Emmanuelle Delmas-Glass (YCBA), and
                  Matthew Hargraves (YCBA). Beyond the PMC and YCBA, we have
                  been fortunate to work with some wonderful people in creating
                  this journal. Adrian Cooper of Intelligent Heritage has guided
                  us through the many pathways of the digital realm and
                  open-access publishing. Bernard Horrocks’s advice and
                  inspiration in all matters associated with copyright, image
                  permissions, and fair dealing has been invaluable. Tessa
                  Kilgarriff came on board to assist with the huge task of
                  sourcing all the images. Rose Bell, our copy editor, refined
                  and polished the texts throughout. And our peer reviewers
                  offered constructive feedback, greatly helping to shape the
                  contents. We are indebted to the generosity and support of the
                  many institutions, organizations, and individuals, who
                  provided images for us to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Furthermore, the journal would not exist without the
                  phenomenal creativity and talents of our designers and
                  developers at
                  <a href="#http-keepthinking-it" target="_blank">Keepthinking</a>, led by Cristiano Bianchi. We have developed this journal in
                  tandem with this extraordinary team and our thanks go in
                  particular to Tom Heather, Lelia Mak, Parahat Melayev, Luca
                  Rosean, Evgenia Spinaki, and Katy Swainston.

                <p>
                  The day-to-day work and many hours of correspondence,
                  technical development, image sourcing, and uploading of
                  content has been borne by a small and very dedicated team at
                  the PMC. Hana Leaper, Editorial Assistant Postdoctoral Fellow,
                  and Tom Scutt, Digital Manager, who both joined the PMC in the
                  autumn of 2014 and have made an enormous contribution to the
                  development and delivery of <em>BAS</em>; we offer them our
                  deepest thanks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, we thank our authors, for providing us with excellent
                  scholarship and endless enthusiasm. They were prepared to take
                  a risk on a journal that did not yet exist; we hope that
                  they—and you—are pleased and captivated by the results!

                  For the six million and more annual visitors to the National
                  Gallery in London, Britain’s most popular museum of historical
                  painting, “British art” is represented by a selection of work
                  by just ten artists—mostly English, all white men, and all
                  born within eighty years of one another. Is it any wonder that
                  British art can sometimes seem like an exclusive club with
                  prohibitive requirements for entry?
                </p>
                <p>
                  The immaculate, beautifully conserved array of painting from
                  <a href="#http-www-nationalgallery-org-uk-visiting-floorplans-level-2-room-34" target="_blank">Hogarth to Turner</a>
                  in the Sackler and adjacent rooms is a consequence of a legal
                  separation, decreed by the
                  <a href="#http-www-legislation-gov-uk-ukpga-1954-65-pdfs-ukpga-19540065-en-pdf" target="_blank">National Gallery and Tate Gallery Act 1954</a>. It comprises a few select paintings which, for the most
                  part, were judged worthy of inclusion alongside the prevailing
                  canon of Western European art, while the majority of the
                  national collection of British painting became the charge of
                  the newly independent Tate. British art at the National
                  Gallery is thus a wholly modern, establishment vision of a
                  presumed Golden Age: a paragon of nineteenth-century taste,
                  distilled by twentieth-century cultural policy and inflected
                  by twenty-first-century curatorial practice. The handful of
                  subsequent acquisitions—<a href="#http-www-nationalgallery-org-uk-paintings-thomas-gainsborough-mr-and-mrs-andrews" target="_blank"><em>Mr and Mrs Andrews</em></a>
                  by Thomas Gainsborough in 1960, <em>Whistlejacket</em> by
                  George Stubbs in 1997 (<a href="#nstaba-fig1">fig. 1</a>)—only
                  reconfirm the exclusionary nature of the canon of British art.

                  The same postwar decade that shaped the presence of British
                  art in Trafalgar Square also witnessed the broadcast in 1955
                  and subsequent publication of Nikolaus Pevsner’s affectionate
                  reflections on the
                  <a href="#http-www-bbc-co-uk-programmes-p00h9llv" target="_blank"><em>Englishness of English Art</em></a>. Around the same time, a new generation of artists emerged
                  whose work disturbed the sentimentality of what Pevsner
                  famously termed the “geography of art”. David Hockney’s
                  painting
                  <em>Man Stood in Front of his House with Rain Descending</em>
                  (1962; <a href="#nstaba-fig2">fig. 2</a>), also known as
                  <em>The Idiot</em>, does this by presenting a catalogue of
                  clichés of Britishness: its architecture, dress codes, habits.
                  In its content, its painterly figuration, in the droll textual
                  framing of its title, and even its size—it occupies the same
                  wall space as a full-length portrait by Joshua Reynolds or
                  Gainsborough—it is at once quintessentially, undeniably
                  British (or should that be English?) <em>and</em> contemptuous
                  of the patriarchal confines of its own, rain-soaked national
                  mythology.

                  <em>The Idiot</em> was completed a few months before Hockney
                  quit the British Isles for the sun and swimming pools of
                  California. By the end of the decade the painting itself had
                  been relocated abroad, and is now one of the highlights of a
                  major international collection of modern and contemporary art
                  at the
                  <a href="#http-smak-be" target="_blank">Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst</a>
                  in Ghent. Within this richly mobile context, the Britishness
                  of Hockney’s painting has been magnified, and refracted, for a
                  largely non-British audience: it is at once compelling and
                  absurd.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The paradox of British art that plays out so explicitly in
                  Hockney’s work of the early sixties (and in different ways on
                  the walls of the National Gallery) becomes apparent every time
                  a work of art, or collection of works, is made, looked upon,
                  or labelled as such. Consider, for example, the gilt-edged
                  collection of British art endowed to Yale University by
                  <a href="#http-britishart-yale-edu" target="_blank">Paul Mellon</a>; or the globally dispersed holdings of the UK
                  <a href="#http-www-gac-culture-gov-uk" target="_blank">Government Art Collection</a>; or the more recent integration of British painting as a
                  permanent feature at the Louvre. Each one is a construction of
                  British art shaped over time by private interest and public
                  ambition; each, in its own way, revealing of the illusive
                  character of British art.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We continue to think about, and assign value to, art in
                  national categories for many good reasons, but how do such
                  labels enable or interfere with an understanding of the
                  mobility of art, artists, and ideas over time; with
                  established notions of chronology, style and influence; or
                  with critical issues of race, class, and gender that have done
                  so much to enliven modern academic and curatorial practice? Is
                  there still any purpose in identifying works of art made in
                  (or of, or on behalf of) the British Isles as “British” first
                  and foremost?
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the one hand, it might seem necessary, natural even, to
                  acknowledge the physical and political geographies in which
                  works of art become meaningful, and to explore the patterns
                  that emerge over time as a result of institutional,
                  linguistic, and other cultural localities. On the other, to
                  invoke a “British School” can seem antiquated and inward
                  looking—of little value other than as a sale room shorthand
                  for placing works of uncertain authorship. We must also
                  question whether such a concept is capable of registering the
                  constitutive role of the visual arts in Britain’s long
                  imperial history (including the tumultuous politics of
                  regional and national identity within the British Isles).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In short, if we are to continue to associate with, argue over,
                  and invest in this most basic of taxonomies, it seems
                  appropriate every so often to reflect upon the multiple
                  challenges that the category of “British art” raises by
                  imagining, if only for a moment, that there may be no such
                  thing at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The diverse responses to that proposition, published here,
                  emerged from a symposium held under the aegis of the British
                  Art Research School at the University of York on 22 May 2014.
                  That event coincided with a European parliamentary election
                  that was characterized by a significant rise in the influence
                  and profile of nationalist parties across the European Union,
                  as well as by a growing critique of the EU’s supranational
                  programme from the political left. It was also a time when
                  media attention began to turn in earnest towards the then
                  forthcoming referendum on Scottish independence, during which
                  the politics of Britishness was subject to different (and
                  ongoing) kinds of pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These contemporary reminders of the fractured and contested
                  complexion of Britishness were rarely far from view as those
                  gathered in York collectively put British art to the test,
                  calling on works of art and makers from the most recent to the
                  very distant past. In preparation for that event, there was no
                  call for papers, no abstracts submitted, no individual titles
                  put forward—just one proposition, or provocation, to which
                  each participant was invited to reply in whichever way they
                  saw fit. The concise responses that resulted, and the
                  wide-ranging discussion that ensued, have provided the
                  inspiration for this, the inaugural “Conversation Piece” of
                  <em>British Art Studies</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the same spirit of experiment, and play, the interventions
                  that appear on these pages will contribute to a broader and
                  ongoing exchange involving the readers of the journal. The
                  first three responses—from Liz Prettejohn, John Munns, and
                  Richard Wentworth—have been published with the launch of the
                  first issue of <em>BAS</em>. They will be followed over the
                  coming weeks by three further “waves”, each foregrounding the
                  ideas of other artists, art historians, and curators.
                  Throughout this time, the journal’s comment page will remain
                  open, for all those with an interest in British art (past,
                  present, or future) to join the debate. The aim is to take on
                  a big issue with a light touch, without agenda, and it is a
                  conversation to which every reader is warmly
                  <a href="#disqus-thread">invited to contribute</a>.

                  There certainly was no such thing as British art at Harvard
                  University when I was an undergraduate there in the early
                  1980s, despite the fact that the Fogg Museum has one of the
                  finest collections of British art in the United States.
                  British pictures were confined to the back stairs, or propped
                  on blocks in the corridor. We occasionally bumped into them
                  with our book bags, but they did not feature in the teaching
                  programme.
                </p>
                <p>
                  More strangely, there was no such thing as British art at the
                  Courtauld Institute in London, either, when I arrived there as
                  an MA student in 1985. There was some study of British
                  architecture, but not painting or sculpture. I’m not sure
                  there’s any parallel for this: we would think it bizarre not
                  to find the study of French art thriving in a leading French
                  art-historical institution, ditto for Italian, or Dutch,
                  Russian, Hungarian, or Chinese.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That was thirty years ago, and a lot has changed. However,
                  after a period of zeal in the 1990s, I do wonder whether we
                  have backtracked in confidence about the value of studying
                  British art. As an expression of British national identity, or
                  Britain’s imperial project, British art remains a perfectly
                  respectable field of historical enquiry, but such emphases
                  have allowed us to evade potentially uncomfortable questions
                  about aesthetic value: or, to put it bluntly, to ask whether
                  British art is any <em>good</em>.

                  And yet, more or less secretly, even guiltily, people actually
                  love British art as <em>art</em>—as something wonderful to
                  look at and think about in complex ways. For the millions who
                  consume British art (in galleries or virtually) around the
                  word, that love is relatively uncomplicated. But it produces a
                  distinctly odd result in much scholarship, where the note of
                  moral disapproval about the nationalistic or imperialistic
                  character, on the “British” side, assorts strangely with the
                  claims made on the “art” side. In the US context, I’d
                  conjecture, the “British” side doesn’t seem very important,
                  and the “art” side remains unproven, or positively
                  problematical; and that may be true in the global context too.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Consider, for example, the recent work by the Korean artist
                  <a href="#http-www-baejoonsung-com" target="_blank">Bae Joonsung</a>, which features paintings by John William Waterhouse and
                  Lawrence Alma-Tadema in a complex composition involving
                  lenticular technology. Should we be pleased that British
                  nineteenth-century art is so conspicuous in the international
                  contemporary art world; or should we worry about whether its
                  role in this context is to represent “kitsch”?
                </p>
                <p>
                  I think we still need to tackle the “art” side—then we can get
                  beyond the stock examples and the knee-jerk connotations they
                  invoke. We need to look much more seriously at a far wider
                  range of works whose value is genuinely uncertain. Forget they
                  are “British”, for the moment, and ask whether they’re worth
                  looking at as “art”—and by that I don’t mean mere visual
                  delight (though I am much in favour of visual delight), I mean
                  do they make us think more creatively, and look more
                  intelligently?
                </p>
                <p>
                  The argument is best made visually, with a selection of
                  paintings from the period I study (<a href="#nstaba-figure3">figs. 3–9</a>)—works that so far have evaded serious scholarly attention,
                  and which remain on the “back stairs” of art history.

                <p>
                  It’s hard to see art and not know its provenance. There’s
                  probably a short, sanctified period in childhood when one
                  might encounter things which don’t fit into tidy cultural
                  categories and, slowly learning that they might be art, not
                  exactly locate them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For a twentieth-century child growing up in southern England
                  and speaking English as their first language, it won’t have
                  taken me long to have understood that there were other
                  adjacencies—the Welsh, the Scots, the Irish, and the French.
                  At a time when cars were distinct objects and carried
                  “nationhood” about their form it was common practice, as much
                  as collecting stamps, to notice differences and describe
                  different origins. The French built cars, as did the Swedish,
                  the Germans, the Italians, even the Dutch and the Spanish, but
                  not the Irish. The time it took for those identities to
                  dissolve into a general world of Japanese and American
                  components assembled into assorted amalgams runs parallel to
                  my most focused questioning of cultural identity.

                  Anybody who travels notices different dispositions, usually
                  climatically driven though often architecturally described.
                  Nobody is going to confuse walking down a street in Havana
                  with a stroll in Hove.

                  If you know even a little bit about the European story in
                  relation to the historic East and the new West you already
                  have a lot to consider. It seems impossible to live in these
                  islands without understanding religious histories and
                  orthodoxies, the monarchy, and the overall sense of a
                  mercantile middle class peaking and troughing. It would also
                  be hard not to have internalized that it is not a federated
                  structure, even though there are powerful national
                  distinctions harboured within the ugly umbrella of “UK” (a
                  relatively recent device to evade saying Britain or Great
                  Britain).

                <p>
                  The impulse towards art making seems to have numerous sources,
                  and in Britain something to do with trades and crafts never
                  seems very far away. There is always a strong sense, rather
                  like much of our food and material well-being, that things and
                  ideas are being imported and adapted and sometimes
                  re-exported. The Mississippi/Liverpool connection, say,
                  fuelled pop music in much the same way as the railways
                  encouraged the entente cordiale.

                  The multiple forms of cultural expression from film to
                  television, clothing to music, games to cuisine, wrapping
                  around codes of sexuality, marriage, and death, are beyond
                  elaborate.

                  It’s rare for me to see artistic activity and not nominate its
                  bloodline. I think it’s part of my critical apparatus and I
                  often ascribe passport as well as gender. I’m not always
                  right. I think of the greater part of British art production
                  as being in a conversation with Europe as much as its
                  implication in the transatlantic drift, largely fudged by the
                  pity that few British people speak more than their own
                  language. I’m not being judgmental, but I am suggesting that
                  there are long lines of interest and engagement in any work of
                  art. It’s true that there is something that can be mistaken
                  for anti-intellectualism in British art which is often
                  extruded through the aperture marked humorous, or baulked up
                  with a sometimes visible philosophical force field.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are questions of scale which come directly from
                  perceptions of landscape and the politics of space—a row of
                  brownstones never feels in any way like a British street.
                  Everybody knows that the sea can never be more than seventy
                  miles away and an island mentality is a distinct condition.
                  Ours comes with eight weather systems and the possibility of
                  four types of weather in a single day. There is never
                  consistent strong sun so there are never black shadows, so
                  Goya wasn’t going to live here. I think the weather test, or
                  rather the fall of light, is mightily powerful, pretty much
                  political.

                  who I think best represents the conundrum of British art. A
                  bit German, partial to the French, knocking around in North
                  London with a graphical awareness, a big appetite, and a
                  strong sense for “a bit of rough”. I think any examination of
                  the music hall would take you on a line out through the
                  history of television, pop music, and British art.

                  medieval context.”
                </h1>
                <p>
                  In the High Middle Ages not only was there no such thing as
                  British art, there was no such thing as “British” and no such
                  thing as “art”, at least not in the senses in which they might
                  be used today. It’s not that “British” and “art” mean nothing
                  in the medieval context, but they don’t mean the same as they
                  do in the modern world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Having said that, some of the problems with regard to
                  “British” (if not to “art”) are surprisingly similar. Take,
                  for example, Peter Paul Rubens’s ceiling in the Banqueting
                  House at Whitehall. The central canvas depicts
                  <em>The Apotheosis of King James I</em>, one of Rubens’s
                  sketches for which lives at Tate Britain. The
                  <a href="#http-www-tate-org-uk-whats-on-tate-britain-exhibition-rubens-apotheosis-james-i-and-other-studies" target="_blank">blurb</a>
                  that accompanied an exhibition of that sketch in 2008–9
                  describes it as “a unique treasure in the history of British
                  art.” The Tate, reasonably and matter-of-factly, states it to
                  be a work of British art. In fairness, the sketch probably was
                  produced in Britain, but the finished painting was not. The
                  <em>Apotheosis</em> may be British in some senses
                  (commissioned by a British patron, for a British destination,
                  and with a peculiarly British subject matter), but it also is
                  the work of a Flemish artist, painted in Flanders, in a
                  Flemish Baroque style.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rubens’s friend Anthony van Dyck was also from the Low
                  Countries, but surely nobody would exclude his portraits of
                  Charles I from the canon of British art? Unlike Rubens, Van
                  Dyck moved to Britain, lived here, and died here. His
                  portraits of King Charles were made here. Whilst here, his
                  style developed into something that would lead to a long and
                  rather distinctive tradition of British portraiture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1984 there was an exhibition at the Hayward Gallery
                  entitled <em>English Romanesque Art</em>. “English”, in this
                  case, not “British”, but never mind, for the sake of the
                  argument it might as well have been. Ask any group of medieval
                  art historians which objects such an exhibition should contain
                  and they would come up with pretty similar lists. They would
                  certainly all include the Bury Bible. If only it wasn’t fixed
                  down they would probably all want the Winchester Cathedral
                  font. Now, the Bury Bible was made in Bury St Edmunds, but the
                  man who made it, Master Hugo, was almost certainly not from
                  Britain. In all probability the Winchester font was not even
                  made in Britain, let alone by British craftsmen.

                  The Warwick ciborium (<a href="#nstaba-figure9">fig. 9</a>) is
                  the work of a Mosan craftsman. Its typological schema,
                  however, probably derives from Worcester, and before that from
                  Canterbury.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  So the schema could be “British”, but the figure style is
                  Mosan. It may have been produced here, or in the Meuse Valley.
                  It might represent the work of an artist from modern-day
                  Belgium, working in the local style, but on a distinctively
                  British subject matter, probably for a British patron and for
                  use in Britain. This man, I think, would be our
                  twelfth-century Rubens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Two other ciboria exist that are almost identical to the
                  Warwick ciborium, the main difference being their figure
                  style. Their closest stylistic corollaries are to be found in
                  English manuscript illumination. They were made either by
                  Mosan craftsmen who moved to Britain and went native, or
                  British craftsmen trained by a Mosan master. Whichever way,
                  let these be our twelfth-century Anthony van Dycks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The point is this. In order for the category of “British art”
                  to mean something across the centuries from the twelfth to the
                  twenty-first, it can be little more closely defined than “art
                  that pertains in some way to the island of Great Britain”, and
                  this makes it a very inclusive category indeed. In the
                  majority of ways in which the term might be understood more
                  recently, “British art” makes no sense in the high medieval
                  context. On the other hand, if we were to mount an exhibition
                  called, say, “British Romanesque Art”, we probably all know
                  what would be in it. Everything would pertain in some way to
                  Britain; little if any of it would pertain to Britain
                  exclusively. Perhaps the question, then, is not so much
                  whether there is such a thing as British Art, but in what
                  sense, if any, is it a useful category?

                  From the founding of the Royal Academy in 1768, historical
                  painting possessed a ghostly authority. Joshua Reynolds
                  praised it but did not devote his practice to it; Benjamin
                  West’s exclusive appointment as “Historical Painter to the
                  King” ended in suspicion and ill feeling. No other genre
                  better indicates the gulf between the taste of patrons,
                  connoisseurs, and the exhibition-going public, and the
                  ambitions of the emergent professional artist in the Academy’s
                  orbit. Over the course of the long eighteenth century, many
                  were sceptical that there was—or ever could be—(a viable)
                  historical painting in Britain.

                  In September 1855, the <em>Art Journal</em>’s monthly column,
                  “British Artists: Their Style and Character”, begins with a
                  fable designed to sum up the perils of attempting to earn a
                  living as a historical painter in Britain.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  The story is of an artist who “finding little or no patronage”
                  and burdened with a studio full of unsold objects leaves town
                  after informing a trustworthy friend of his plan to fake his
                  own death. The friend is instructed to close the artist’s
                  house not long after his departure and to disseminate the
                  message that he had “died suddenly”. The paintings are then to
                  be sold by auction. They sell well, and the artist returns
                  home, content with his newfound status.

                <p>
                  While the term “social death” carries with it implications of
                  racial, religious, and other forms of terror, it can be said
                  that for this allegorical British artist, a kind of “social
                  suicide” is preferable to financial ruin and critical neglect.
                  Indeed, during the period, this particular strain of artistic
                  practice was marked by precarity. James Barry’s demise and
                  Benjamin Haydon’s suicide serve as only the most infamous case
                  studies of the British historical painter’s premature
                  proximity to his own mortality.

                  It is the lesser-known William Hilton (1786–1839) whose
                  biography is introduced by the fable. No self-conscious
                  martyr, Hilton’s career was nonetheless informed by the
                  spectre of death. With industrial capitalism flourishing
                  during his lifetime, the risk—moreover the life-threatening
                  danger—of attempting to earn a living painting grand-scale
                  historical subjects was at this point almost a cliché. To
                  follow this path was to disavow bravely the increasing
                  commodification of artists and artworks. Furthermore, in
                  common with his generation, Hilton’s access to canonical
                  ancient sculptures and old-master paintings was defined by the
                  French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars and their outcome.
                  The artist was finally able to visit the Continent in 1814; in
                  the Louvre he sketched looted works, some of which were
                  imminently to be packed up and reinstated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Precarity becomes visible through the artist’s use of
                  materials. In pursuit of dazzling effects that could quickly
                  call to mind the aura of old-master works, many academic
                  painters followed Joshua Reynolds’s example by mixing an array
                  of additives to their pigments and oil-binding mediums. Yet in
                  certain works Hilton exceeded all others with this approach.
                  He employed harmful substances such as megilp and bitumen in
                  abundance. Late works such as his
                  <a href="#http-www-tate-org-uk-art-artworks-hilton-sir-calepine-rescuing-serena-n00178" target="_blank"><em>Sir Calepine Rescuing Serena</em></a>
                  (exhibited 1831) and
                  <a href="#http-www-tate-org-uk-art-artworks-hilton-editha-and-the-monks-searching-for-the-body-of-harold-n00333" target="_blank"><em>Editha and the Monks Searching for the Body of Harold</em></a>
                  (exhibited 1834) were painted at a time when the discourse
                  surrounding the damage caused by these materials would have
                  been unavoidable for a Royal Academician, let alone Keeper of
                  the Academy: a post Hilton held from 1827.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As such, these works can be seen to anticipate the
                  Auto-destructive art developed by Gustav Metzger in 1959.
                  Conceived as “a form of public art for industrial societies”
                  that “demonstrates man’s power to accelerate disintegrative
                  processes of nature”, the concept was Metzger’s response to
                  the ravages of war and an attack on capitalist values.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  The precarious position of Hilton’s paintings within the
                  history of British art, and the extent of their ongoing
                  deterioration, suggest that Hilton was aware of their eventual
                  decay. The humanist values that formerly sustained historical
                  painting were declining simultaneously. Paintings by Hilton
                  materialize such moral decay.

                  The accompanying image (<a href="#nstaba-figure10">fig. 10</a>) is a visual aid that uses Hilton to open up British art,
                  its style, and its character. Painted in oils, text is
                  symbolic rather than pertaining to narrative, emphasizing the
                  dominance of the written word in relation to high-artistic
                  practice. The quote in white is lifted from the
                  <em>A Century of British Painters</em> (1866) by Richard and
                  Samuel Redgrave, who consistently denigrate Hilton’s material
                  practice. At the top are extracts from the artist’s letters
                  from Italy in 1825. Some lines from John Clare’s poem “What is
                  Life?”, published at the time Hilton met Clare and was
                  commissioned to paint his
                  <a href="#http-www-npg-org-uk-collections-search-portrait-mw01307-john-clare" target="_blank">portrait</a>
                  of 1820, match the sense of <em>vanitas</em> conveyed in the
                  materiality of the artist’s works. Streams of collage evoke
                  the fragmentation of the classical tradition and the variety
                  of emulation associated with historical painting. Composed of
                  pieces of paintings by Titian, Peter Paul Rubens, and
                  Correggio, drawings by Hilton, and details from works by Barry
                  and Haydon, they conjure the <em>craquelure</em> of paint. At
                  the centre is Hilton’s

                  I have never been very keen on exam questions, and “There’s no
                  such thing as British art” is horribly like one. “Discuss.”
                  Its ability to unnerve is surely to do with its similarity to
                  questions of the “Have you stopped defrauding the Revenue?”
                  type— “Answer yes or no.” So I don’t think it’s irrelevant of
                  me to say at the start that I am not at all sure that the
                  demand to know whether British art exists is the right
                  question. More germane is what it is for. Many objections can
                  be levelled at the idea of British art—political,
                  definitional, and conceptual—but I want to say that its
                  advantages are also substantial, if pragmatic.

                  When, in the mid-1980s, I wrote a PhD thesis in a Department
                  of English Literature, I think it is true to say that there
                  was little or no anxiety about whether there was an “English
                  Literature” or not. The term was taken unproblematically to
                  mean literature written in the English language. This had the
                  enormous advantage that it was not necessarily national. It
                  was not so much that “English” seemed a natural category—even
                  then that wouldn’t have stood a moment’s real thought—but that
                  the category was sufficiently flexible—or sufficiently
                  fudgeable, if you like—to serve its necessary purpose of
                  defining a field of enquiry.

                <p>
                  When I moved by various stages to work as an art historian,
                  one of the many things that seemed culturally unfamiliar about
                  my new discipline was that the conceptual cake was cut very
                  differently. Among the assumptions that seemed to be taken for
                  granted was that modern art before 1945 meant French art.
                  Modern art in England in the period I was interested in was—as
                  everyone apparently knew quite well—inevitably derivative, and
                  if you could even bring a question like “Was Vorticism a
                  native modernism?” into meaningful focus, you were bound to
                  find that it was not. This state of affairs was compounded
                  rather than improved by the appearance of innovative
                  methodologies during the 1970s and 1980s. The potency of the
                  social history of art was communicated through studies of
                  Impressionism, or Van Gogh, or the Parisian art world, and it
                  was generally assumed in the discipline—or so it seemed to
                  me—that this was inevitable and right.

                <p>
                  There were in fact many historians of British art at work in
                  the 1980s, some doing inspirational work, and I owe deep debts
                  to a number of them. My point is that this work was done
                  against a general background in which the conceptual action
                  seemed from the start to be located largely elsewhere. The
                  organization of art history, the literature that then existed,
                  the routine assumptions, and the sheer weight of attention and
                  traditions of scrutiny, all combined to make “British art”
                  something that needed to be argued for. I do not mean by this
                  that the key thing was to argue for the category, rather the
                  opposite. The category—“British art”—needed to emerge in order
                  to sustain what was truly important: studies of artists and,
                  in the widest sense, their historical contexts, that
                  acknowledged their particularities and specifics and which
                  were not beholden to a more or less distorted version of
                  concepts developed to deal with other subjects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It seemed to me, living through the growth of British art
                  studies in the nineties and after, that the words “British
                  art” were never more than a flag of convenience. That term was
                  a means of getting attention to where it was required. If the
                  origins of the idea of a “national school” as a tool of
                  enquiry and organization were largely lost for art historians,
                  the concept nevertheless continued to provide a major
                  criterion of organization within the discipline and its
                  adjuncts (publishers for instance, or libraries). In that
                  context, it was important to find a recognizable focus through
                  which the communal effort of scrutiny and understanding could
                  take place.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One way of putting this would be to say that the term “British
                  art” eases communication. It makes it possible for publishers’
                  catalogues, advertisements for university jobs, and new
                  journals to hail their likely audiences and to occupy clear
                  positions in a complex series of institutional contexts. I am
                  suggesting that it is this pragmatic presence that provides
                  one of the major strengths of “British art” as an idea. We
                  should refer our criteria to that presence rather than to the
                  more abstract question of its existence: what best builds a
                  context in which we might study (or indeed think it important
                  or feasible to study) the work of artists who lived and worked
                  on this island, for instance, or the modernism of artists in
                  London before and immediately after the First World War?
                  Thirty years ago it was not the case that such things were
                  self-evidently available for study, nor that there was an
                  intellectual context capable of dealing with them. That things
                  are now different is one major gain for the idea of “British
                  art”, however wayward it might be in other ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also think that its very indeterminacy and lack of
                  boundaries makes the category flexible in a productive way.
                  This does not mean that we are unable either to define it at
                  moments, or to adjust the category within which we make and
                  promulgate knowledge. For some time now it’s been the case
                  that “British art” has been responding to the interest in the
                  global, the transatlantic, or the postcolonial in ways that
                  inflect and open up the nature of the field. What is important
                  is that we have a conceptual category in which to focus work
                  and through which to communicate it. We can adjust that
                  category as we need to.

                  The exhibition
                  <em>History Is Now: 7 Artists Take On Britain</em> was staged
                  at the Hayward Gallery, London, in the run-up to the 2015
                  general election. Within this context of debate and
                  decision-making, our aim was to provide a space for the public
                  to reflect on the nation’s recent past, with a view to
                  illuminating the future. The show was also conceived as an
                  experiment. By asking artists to take on the role of curator,
                  we hoped to open up and challenge traditional ideas of British
                  history, art, and culture in unexpected ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After wide-ranging preliminary discussions, I invited seven
                  artists from a variety of backgrounds and artistic positions
                  to each curate a section of the exhibition: John Akomfrah,
                  Roger Hiorns, Simon Fujiwara, Hannah Starkey, Richard
                  Wentworth, and, working together, Jane and Louise Wilson.
                  Behind the decision to enrol the artist as curator was a
                  belief, and trust, in the creative ways that artists engage
                  with the world, as well as a recognition of the intellectual
                  freedoms assumed by (and expected of) them—freedoms that
                  supersede the usual institutional responsibilities of an
                  in-house curatorial team.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the heart of the project was the idea that the
                  artist-curators should focus on British history, although what
                  that meant in practice was open to interpretation, and would
                  indeed be challenged through the inclusion and foregrounding
                  of forgotten, conflicted, and unusual histories. The artists’
                  interests were spread thematically and chronologically across
                  seven decades of postwar British history, and there were no
                  prescriptions as to the content or curatorial approach. As a
                  result, six distinctive positions emerged.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The artists embraced the challenge of creating an exhibition
                  about British history in a gallery of contemporary art in ways
                  that echoed the variety and complexity of the nation’s history
                  itself. Works of art were placed alongside archive material,
                  photographs, and other everyday objects in ways that leaned
                  towards a social history of art, and away from the familiar
                  canon of British art and movements. Numerous and sometimes
                  unexpected themes came to the fore, from the defence of the
                  British coast during the Cold War to the BSE epidemic, or “mad
                  cow disease”, to the post-Thatcher dematerialization of
                  labour. Moreover, these issues were not raised as explicit
                  political critique, or posited as necessarily revisionist, but
                  were representative of the multiple forgotten, alternate, and
                  personal histories usually missed in mainstream recountings of
                  history. From a Pye V4 television of 1953, on which many
                  Britons watched the Queen’s coronation, to Christine Voge’s
                  photographs of 1978 of the first women’s shelter in London,
                  the exhibition as a whole served as a powerful reminder that
                  the grand narratives of history are comprised of intimate
                  stories.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the outdoor terrace we installed a newly restored Bristol
                  Bloodhound surface-to-air missile and launcher, selected by
                  Richard Wentworth and borrowed from the RAF Air Defence Radar
                  Museum in Norfolk (<a href="#nstaba-figure15">fig. 15</a>).
                  Installed by the dozen along the eastern seaboard from the
                  late 1950s, this Cold War weapon was the last line of defence
                  against inbound Russian nuclear bombers. At over eight metres
                  long and gleaming white, overlooking Waterloo Bridge and the
                  River Thames, this was the first time in recent history that
                  such weaponry had been on display in central London. It was
                  not a weapon masquerading as art, but a military artefact
                  evidencing its own historical moment. It recalled, tangibly,
                  the anxiety of a bygone era, while invoking the more recent
                  memory of the Rapier missiles (the current equivalent of the
                  Bristol Bloodhound), which had been controversially installed
                  by the British army on East London rooftops during the 2012
                  Olympics.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the week before the exhibition opened, as we were applying
                  the finishing touches inside the galleries, the BBC reported
                  that Russian Bear bombers carrying nuclear payloads had
                  crossed into British airspace. RAF fighters had been scrambled
                  to intercept the bombers and escort them back to neutral
                  airspace. A quarter of a century after the end of the Cold
                  War, both sides continue to test and provoke one another with
                  reciprocal shows of military strength. Contemporary British
                  art may be wavering in its definition, but the nation’s
                  geo-political boundaries are, it seems, as strong as ever. If
                  we are to consider art as inextricably linked to history, then
                  perhaps it too must accept some national resolve.

                  In 1934 the BBC announced its broadcast of six talks on
                  British art given by Reginald Gleadowe, the Slade Professor of
                  Fine Art at Oxford University between 1928 and 1933, with a
                  striking pamphlet designed by Eric Ravilious (<a href="#nstaba-figure19">fig. 19</a>) and printed by the Kynoch Press, which was noted for its
                  progressive and lively artist-designed typographic collection.
                  No artists are present in the image and, apart from the
                  glimpse of a framed image of a tree in the background, neither
                  are any works of art. Enclosed within a patterned oval are
                  tubes of paint, set squares, a mallet, a compass, a mahlstick,
                  a fanned array of brushes, pencils, and a palette and knife.
                  Here, Ravilious puts the tools of the artist and designer’s
                  trade right at the very centre of British art. There is no
                  hint of the “big names” of British art that one might
                  expect—no Joshua Reynolds, John Constable, or J.M.W. Turner.
                  Painting is referenced, but as part of a larger and connected
                  world of art, design, and craft. Throughout his career, which
                  has recently been the subject of a hugely popular exhibition
                  at
                  <a href="#http-www-dulwichpicturegallery-org-uk-whats-on-exhibitions-2015-april-ravilious" target="_blank">Dulwich Picture Gallery</a>
                  (closed August 2015), Ravilious sought to break down divisions
                  between the artist and the designer, as well as image and text
                  (brought together in this image through pattern and the
                  overlapping composition). His is a vision of British art in
                  which craft, making, and production are given central
                  attention.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ravilious’s cover prompts me to think about what kind of image
                  would adorn the front cover of a promotional booklet, or
                  website, for a series of talks on British art broadcast in
                  2015. Would craft, making, and tools get such a prominent
                  look-in? Probably not. How would an artist or designer go
                  about responding to such a brief today? If there
                  <em>is</em> indeed “no such thing as British art”, perhaps a
                  blank page would do! An infinitely more interesting task would
                  be to commission a cover that in some way tried to capture the
                  diverse, complicated, hybrid nature of British art and British
                  art studies today.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When some of the contributors to this Conversation first met
                  to discuss the provocation, “There’s no such thing as British
                  art”, it was the day of a European election—an event that
                  undoubtedly cast a prescient shadow over our conversations
                  about a nation-bounded terminology for the study of art. The
                  boundaries and definitions of British art have undoubtedly
                  been redrawn in recent years as historians and curators in
                  this field have reflected seriously on the implications of
                  national categorizations in relation to the organization of
                  works of art, artists, and histories of art. Discussions about
                  Britain’s imperial past and postcolonial present have put
                  pressure on the historiography of British art, opening up
                  routes in and routes out of what was once perceived to be, by
                  some, a fairly restricted, closed-off and rarefied field of
                  studies. “British art” is no longer an island within the
                  discipline of the history of art. As a result, “British art”
                  has, in my opinion, become a considerably more expansive,
                  connected, and interesting area in which to work. In some ways
                  I accept that there is no such thing as British art—by which I
                  mean that there certainly isn’t one version or officially
                  sanctioned definition of what it is or is not. And that, to my
                  mind at least, is very much a good thing. What there is,
                  however, is a lively and ever-growing community of
                  researchers, artists, curators, and students all of whom are
                  working with—and sometimes against—British art. In my job as
                  Deputy Director for Research at a centre devoted to the study
                  of British art, I don’t feel the need to defend the concept,
                  but rather to facilitate and indeed champion the brilliant,
                  considered, and varied work carried out in the field of
                  British art studies today.

                <p>
                  If we take the term “British art” at face value, if we
                  understand the term to pertain to the land-mass incorporated
                  by the Acts of Union between England and Scotland of 1706 and
                  1707 (as an historian of the early medieval art produced in
                  Britain and Ireland might be inclined to do), there might well
                  be “arts” that could be considered “British”. However, the
                  ways in which the term has been used to construct and underpin
                  the institutions, museums, collections, and university
                  departments devoted financially and publicly to the study and
                  promotion of what is currently deemed to be “British Art”
                  suggest that, in practice, the term is perhaps not as
                  inclusive as might be hoped.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To demonstrate this it is worth considering, briefly, two arts
                  that might variously be considered “British”, but which are
                  not generally included in the so-called canon of “British
                  art”. The first is the art produced by the Britons―those
                  peoples who lived in mainland Britain between the third
                  century BCE and the fourth century CE―who were, ethnically
                  speaking, a Celtic peoples. Their art can be characterized as
                  one favouring textured reflective surfaces, shifting shapes,
                  and linear patterns constructed from motifs&nbsp;that are arranged
                  to appear simultaneously as both figure and ground. However,
                  while such a distinctive artistic tradition might be
                  identified lexically as “British”, to anyone from the modern
                  countries of Ireland, Scotland, or Wales this would be
                  anathema, as it is, of course, generally defined as “Celtic”
                  art, largely as a result of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
                  movements for cultural and political independence from
                  England. The “Celtic” art of the Britons is thus generally
                  identified with nation states other than England, and in the
                  eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was indeed invoked as an
                  art of resistance to “British” imperialism. Yet, it remains
                  the case that the peoples living in mainland Britain were
                  known collectively as the Britons, and indeed still are
                  (academically). Used in this context, “British art” is
                  something of a troubled term—both for suggesting an art that
                  is largely devoted to what today might be termed “decorative”,
                  “minor”, or “applied” (rather than the fine arts of painting
                  and sculpture), and for describing an art form that was common
                  to the peoples making up Britain and Ireland at the time it
                  was produced.

                  Leaving this to one side, the second example that might be
                  considered is the art produced across these islands in the
                  early historical period from the sixth to the eleventh or
                  twelfth centuries—an art which involves painting (albeit in
                  <a href="#http-www-bl-uk-turning-the-pages-id-fdbcc772-3e21-468d-8ca1-9c192f0f939c-and-type-book" target="_blank">manuscripts</a>, on sculpture, walls, and glass) and sculpture in diverse
                  monumental forms and varying scales, in both stone and ivory.
                  This is an art that not only utilized the various media of the
                  so-called fine arts, but which was also one capable of great
                  abstraction, sophisticated visual ambiguity, and paradox
                  (involving what Mary Carruthers has termed the “polyfocal
                  perspective”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>), as well as remarkable naturalism. This example of “British
                  art” is of course that which is notionally referred to by art
                  historians as “Insular art”, as a means of avoiding the tricky
                  (post-1924) term “British”. For, in the sixth to eighth
                  centuries CE the Britons lived in south-west Scotland, Wales,
                  and Cornwall; the Scots lived in north-west Scotland and
                  Ireland; and various Germanic tribes, comprising collectively
                  the Anglo-Saxons, lived in the area now covered by England,
                  but which at times extended to the Firth of Forth and into
                  Dumfries and Galloway. Modern geo-political terms invoked to
                  denote art or any other cultural phenomenon in this period,
                  verge on the nonsensical.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, when considering the arts produced in the early medieval
                  period it would seem that <em>if</em> “British art” is to
                  continue being promoted institutionally, and <em>if</em> that
                  term is to be deemed lexically relevant to denote the visual
                  arts produced by peoples from the islands of Britain and
                  Ireland, or working elsewhere within its traditions, it is
                  perhaps time to be pro-actively more inclusive in what is
                  denoted by the term. It is perhaps time to actively include
                  and promote the work produced by those from across the entire
                  region of Britain and Ireland, across a wider history (that
                  extends the current working boundaries of the eighteenth
                  through to the early twentieth centuries), and across all
                  media. We are surely well beyond the point in time when it is
                  acceptable to promote as British, art (largely painting and
                  sculpture) primarily produced by the English, wherever they
                  worked―or those from elsewhere working in England―by which
                  “London” is generally understood.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This said, using the term “British” in a postcolonial context
                  does, of course, raise significant issues which the examples
                  cited here have demonstrated. For medievalists, with Ireland
                  and Wales being the oldest of the English colonies, and part
                  of Ireland still being subsumed into that colonial power which
                  is euphemistically referred to as Great Britain, it is
                  difficult indeed to refer to any art produced in the region as
                  “British”.

                  The question of whether or not there is such a thing as
                  British art, for me, is a question of context. For instance,
                  it hardly seems useful to look for and trace particular
                  national characteristics or tastes, especially in an age of
                  increasing opportunities for physical and technological
                  connection. I am more interested in thinking about national
                  contexts as shifting entities, imbued with complex power
                  relations. This includes looking at how national identities
                  are constituted through art and in cultural institutions, as
                  well as looking at how those identities function
                  ideologically, how they are challenged and broken down. In
                  Britain in the 1970s feminist politics was a vital part of
                  this dynamic field of cultural activity.

                  The characterization of Britain in the histories of art and
                  feminism in the 1970s is often limited to Mary Kelly’s
                  six-part installation
                  <a href="#http-www-marykellyartist-com-post-partum-document-html" target="_blank"><em>Post-Partum Document</em></a>
                  (1973–79), Susan Hiller’s
                  <a href="#http-www-susanhiller-org-otherworks-sisters-of-menon-html" target="_blank">paraconceptualism</a>, and Margaret Harrison’s
                  <a href="#http-www-tate-org-uk-art-artworks-harrison-homeworkers-t13631" target="_blank">crafted image-text works</a>, as well as the influential art-historical work of Griselda
                  Pollock, Lisa Tickner, and Rosemary Betterton. But in recent
                  years knowledge and analysis of this field has begun to
                  expand, with many more books, exhibitions, and PhD research
                  projects charting women artists’ work in Britain since the
                  seventies. The practices are diverse, ranging from
                  <a href="#http-www-richardsaltoun-com-exhibitions-26-overview" target="_blank">photography</a>
                  to

                  <a href="#http-www-screenonline-org-uk-film-id-1003712" target="_blank">film</a>, and so too are the artists’ approaches to feminism. But a
                  question that remains to be asked about this complex art
                  history is its relationship to Britain and Britishness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the late 1980s Britain was characterized as the site for
                  the development of a more theoretical feminism, with Pollock,
                  Tickner, and Kelly all publishing important texts espousing
                  theoretical methodologies. However, this categorization,
                  formed in response to attempts at recuperation associated with
                  artists and writers in the United States, has resulted in a
                  problematic “progress narrative”—pithily summed up by Pollock
                  as a genealogy of “American foremothers and British
                  daughters”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  <a href="#edn1" id="ednref1"></a>But if this narrative
                  obscures the diversity of feminist work in Britain, more
                  recent thematic methodologies risk erasing this context
                  altogether. For instance, Helen Molesworth’s article “<a href="#http-www-jstor-org-stable-779234" target="_blank">House Work and Art Work</a>” (2000) counters the divisions between “essentialist”
                  artworks (like Judy Chicago’s <em>The Dinner Party</em>,
                  1974–79) and “theoretical” work (like Kelly’s
                  <em>Post-Partum Document</em>). But in deconstructing the
                  “progress” narrative, she leaves geographic difference by the
                  wayside. And in fact, she erases the problem completely by
                  repatriating Mary Kelly, an American who worked in Britain in
                  the 1970s, into a coterie of American artists. And although
                  histories of second-wave feminism are often critiqued for an
                  Anglo-American focus, it is a far more America-centric
                  history.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite its problems (over-identification, lacunae)
                  transatlantic antagonism was an important part of the women’s
                  art movement. Women artists, critics, and writers exchanged
                  materials and ideas in print, through reproductions and
                  touring exhibitions. The context of this intercontinental
                  interaction means that the national borders we might draw are
                  diffused and disrupted. This is further complicated by the
                  decentralized organizations that structured the Women’s
                  Liberation Movement in the seventies, which extended from
                  micro-level, grass-roots groups to macro-level exchanges
                  across distance. Through these networks of material exchange
                  coherent national identities were splintered. So just as it is
                  important and timely to look again at feminist-influenced art
                  made in Britain, I would dispute that this could really be
                  called British art, and likewise that work produced in the
                  United States could be thought of as definably American. Many
                  of these practices are the product of competing forces,
                  including socio-economic and cultural context, the artist’s or
                  group’s particular brand of feminism, as well as their
                  relationship (antagonistic or celebratory) to other works of
                  art or practices, historical or contemporaneous.

                  Perhaps this is best illustrated in relation to two
                  installations:
                  <a href="#http-womanhouse-refugia-net" target="_blank"><em>Womanhouse</em></a>
                  and <em>A Woman’s Place</em>. The first, <em>Womanhouse</em>,
                  opened in Los Angeles in 1972; the second,
                  <em>A Woman’s Place</em>, in South London in 1974 (<a href="#nstaba-figure21">fig. 21</a>). The later work was conceived as a version of the earlier;
                  it sought to mimic the collaborative enterprise of
                  <em>Womanhouse</em>, in which its women participants found,
                  converted, and made art within a domestic setting. Both
                  projects subverted women’s traditional “place” through
                  incisive feminist critique of the home and domestic labour.
                  But unlike the clean surfaces and bright colours of
                  <em>Womanhouse</em>, made in the context of Judy Chicago’s
                  feminist art programme, <em>A Woman’s Place</em> was tatty,
                  run-down, and knee-deep in rubbish, to paraphrase Tickner’s
                  description of the work in <em>Studio International</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The stale materiality of the London work seemed to play out
                  the trajectory of its transatlantic journey, entropically
                  transforming pristine surfaces into a crumbling mess. But this
                  difference is a not a metaphor for British art’s belatedness.
                  And neither can we say that <em>Womanhouse</em> or
                  <em>A Woman’s Place</em> stand for “American” or “British” art
                  more broadly. Instead if we take the conversation between the
                  two works as our subject, difference becomes a matter of
                  context: Walt Disney-funded Californian art school versus
                  South London squat; young students versus working mothers
                  without commercial or Arts Council support. The local context
                  of each work, then, opens out onto national issues such as the
                  West/East Coast divide in America or the economic downturn in
                  Britain in the 1970s.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By focusing on the relationship between these works, we can
                  begin to get a sense of the conversations flowing between
                  women nationally and internationally, while also seeing when
                  this communication fails to translate, as very similar
                  projects play out very differently. So across this dense field
                  of interaction and exchange—comprised of hold-ups, hitches,
                  and miscommunications—the question of British or American art
                  is not so much about the national as the translocal; not
                  identity, but identification and misidentification; and more
                  about distance than difference. In the context of second-wave
                  feminism, British art came under the same pressure as other
                  fine art definitions and classifications. Focus shifted from
                  particular aesthetics, associated with types and stereotypes,
                  to a diverse field of experiment and exchange. So there may be
                  no definably British Feminist Art but, crucially, we are yet
                  to map how this political vitality impacted on art, cultural
                  production, and institutions in the United Kingdom.

                  There is a fine Jacob Epstein in the British art collection at
                  Carrick Hill near Adelaide, Australia, the home created in the
                  1930s by Edward and Ursula Hayward, and now open to the public
                  as a country-house museum. It is not the sort of Epstein that
                  one might expect to find: not a bronze bust of Lady Hayward,
                  or even one of the artist’s experiments in direct carving.
                  Instead, the Haywards acquired a painting entitled
                  <em>Lilies</em> (1936;
                  <a href="#nstaba-figure22">fig. 22</a>), one of four
                  hundred-odd flower studies that Epstein made in one of his
                  occasional orgies of painting. It was a moment of defiant
                  departure from his sculptural practice, and it suits the
                  collection at Carrick Hill because the house is set in
                  beautiful gardens, and because Ursula Hayward loved lilies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If an aim of the present debate is to develop a paradigm, or
                  to evaluate a canon, of British art, then Epstein’s
                  <em>Lilies</em> is not a good example. But its location at
                  Carrick Hill points to the expansiveness of the category of
                  British art, and to its rich variety and unpredictability: its
                  mobility across the British Empire, which has left Australia
                  with some of the best collections of British art in the world;
                  its absorption of that empire’s resources, which stocked
                  institutions such as the British Museum, where Epstein learned
                  so much about non-European art; its significance for
                  anglophile creations such as Carrick Hill, with its Jacobethan
                  manor house overlooking Adelaide and the great expanses of the
                  Australian bush; and its inclusiveness of artists such as
                  Epstein, an American Jew of East European origin, who arrived
                  in London as a young man, and ended his days a central figure
                  in British art and a knight of the realm. If British art is
                  anything, it is many things, in many different places. Its
                  traditions and genealogies must constantly adjust to
                  accommodate the news from everywhere and nowhere, and the
                  shifting boundaries, and hence definitions, of Britishness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The seam of material and contexts that coalesce around the
                  idea of British art is rich, and there remains much to mine
                  and to re-evaluate. So why do I sense a degree of anxiety
                  behind the motion that
                  <em>there’s no such thing as British art</em>? Does it suggest
                  a research community that has talked itself into a corner of
                  self-doubt? That after several decades of ground-breaking
                  research, and strategic challenges to disciplinary prejudice
                  against the very idea of British art, we fear a loss of
                  momentum, a shifting of attention, even an obsolescence of the
                  questions and discoveries that have so energized the field? If
                  this is the case, then I am not sure that arguing the point
                  all over again is the right way forward. British art matters.
                  The case has been made. The problem surely has to do with the
                  larger one of academic specialization, the absence of a
                  general conversation across isolated fields of enquiry, and
                  the limitations of a traditional model of national schools in
                  a curriculum that is moving towards a global history of art.
                  The challenge becomes one of connection, and of finding a
                  place in that global dialogue, in its radical sense as a
                  mapping of transnational contacts and networks, rather than as
                  a compilation of local case studies. In such a forum, values
                  adjust. The qualities that can make British art seem so
                  nebulous—so provisional, contingent, peripheral, even
                  derivative—become the most interesting thing about it. Maybe
                  it has indeed become redundant. Or maybe our motion is less a
                  provocation to British art studies, than a blueprint for its
                  future direction.

                <p>
                  In the discourse around British Modernism, my own patch,
                  reference to Englishness, Britishness, or Scottishness has
                  featured in commentary on many leading artistic figures (John
                  Duncan Fergusson, Paul Nash, Stanley Spencer, Henry Moore,
                  Peter Lanyon, David Hockney, Richard Long, Gilbert &amp;
                  George, to name a diverse few). The categorization sometimes
                  mattered to the artists themselves. In broader terms, it crops
                  up too in the writing of key critics of the period, including
                  Roger Fry, Herbert Read, Kenneth Clark, and Nikolaus Pevsner.
                  The conceptions of “Britishness” invoked by these artists and
                  writers are as diverse as the work they produced and
                  discussed, but might include reference to native precursors
                  (Romantic landscape painting, for example); perceived
                  predispositions (linearity, a love of nature, eccentricity,
                  emotional reticence, and so on); or implied contrasts with the
                  stereotypical characteristics of other cultures (the boldness
                  of American art, for example). Talk about national
                  identity—whether in relation to art, literature, cooking, or
                  politics—tends to involve a cocktail of affirmation and
                  differentiation: it expresses tribal loyalty, and the need for
                  self-esteem and self-realization, in tandem with a sense of
                  difference, fear, and inferiority/superiority in relation to
                  some “other”.

                  Concepts of nationality can function as both stick and carrot.
                  A negatively tinged example comes from David Sylvester’s
                  review of a Walter Sickert centenary show in 1960: "The
                  tragic flaw in English painting is compromise, unwillingness
                  to be committed to a point of view, a desire to have the best
                  of two or more worlds (especially, in our time, a present and
                  a past world)."<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup><a href="#edn1" id="ednref1"></a> More affirmatively, a
                  defensive emphasis on national identity could serve as an
                  antidote to a perceived excess of “influence” from abroad,
                  just as asserting an internationalist ethos could work against
                  parochialism, or an oppressive nationalism. In relation to the
                  latter, a helpful reflection comes from the leading painter
                  Graham Sutherland in a letter of 25 January 1947 to the
                  <em>New Statesman</em> about Benedict Nicolson’s survey of
                  “the changes which have taken place during the last thirty
                  years”:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    During the course of his argument—that English painting has
                    gained by the enforced insularity of the war—Mr. Nicolson
                    writes of myself (and others) as
                    <em>having turned their backs on Paris to seek inspiration in
                      the English romantic movement of the early nineteenth
                      century</em>. I cannot let this pass. Current art criticism is
                    peculiarly absolutist; and here is yet another example of
                    the habit of art historians to oversimplify—to label and to
                    pigeonhole. I do not deny that I received great adolescent
                    stimulus from Palmer and Blake; but that does not mean I
                    turn my back on Paris. The question of influences is not as
                    easy as that, and is surely a more complex and subtle matter
                    than can be covered by such snap judgements. Painters are
                    affected by things which come to them from all over the
                    place; from many kinds of painting and many things. One
                    absorbs what one needs at a given time.

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Palmer was actually much more than an “adolescent stimulus”,
                  rather an ongoing point of reference, which demonstrates that
                  attitudes in this terrain are usually rooted in polemic and
                  propaganda. Sutherland’s approach to imagery, technique, and
                  style in a work such as <em>Black Landscape</em> (1940;
                  <a href="#nstaba-figure23">fig. 23</a>), for example, owed as
                  much to Palmer’s
                  <em>A Cornfield by Moonlight, with the Evening Star</em>, then
                  in Kenneth Clark’s collection, as it did to the remote west
                  Pembrokeshire landscape, or to what one contemporary critic
                  called “spiritual agony [and] suffering of a society at war”.
                  But to generalize from Sutherland’s point, we might assert
                  that significant artists (British or otherwise) are always
                  rooted in their own immediate environment and its traditions,
                  in conscious and unconscious ways, but also responsive to
                  wider, international stimuli, whether or not because of an
                  émigré background. Sylvester’s observation about compromise
                  seems a crude caricature. Interesting art tends to be invested
                  in a more complex sense of identity than the simplistic “them
                  and us” polarities that prevail elsewhere (for example,
                  politics). And in relation to the individual we often need to
                  allow for the possibility of at least “dual nationality”: an
                  artist’s perceived personal and artistic roots might be both
                  British and English/Scottish/Cornish/Jewish/West
                  Indian/Romanian (Home Counties Sutherland gets claimed as
                  Welsh for his reliance on Pembrokeshire motifs).

                  Following Gombrich’s remark about art in general, we might say
                  there is no such thing as (quintessentially) British art;
                  there are only “British” (in whatever qualified sense) artists
                  who, in the production of their work, draw upon a cluster of
                  self-identifications (positive and negative), and respond to a
                  complex array of points of reference, influences, and
                  determinants (cultural, social, educational, genetic), both
                  long- and short-term. We are left with one all-purpose
                  question: how, where (if anywhere), and why did some
                  particular sense of British identity or tradition enter into
                  the making or reception of specific works of art? For British,
                  one could substitute all sorts of other things, which might or
                  might not be more interesting in specific cases. Artists are
                  indeed affected by things which come to them from all over the
                  place. They absorb what they need at a given time. The devil,
                  as always, is in the detail.

                  “The history of the Hugh Lane Gallery neatly encapsulates the
                  conundrum of Ireland’s relationship with Britain.”
                </h1>
                <p>
                  In the course of my writing this conversation piece, a
                  controversy erupted concerning the use of the term “British”
                  in an Irish context. It concerned the appropriation, by Sky
                  journalist Richard Suchet, of Irish actress Saoirse Ronan as
                  British, and reference that she was “one of our own” because
                  she was from “the British Isles”—a claim, Suchet went on to
                  suggest, that should be taken as “a compliment”. The ensuing
                  furore both in printed and social media aptly demonstrates how
                  the use of the word “British”, in an Irish context, can be
                  both a maligned and loaded term. It demonstrates how
                  Anglo-Irish relations can still be marked by a sense of
                  condescension (albeit benign), and resultant indignation. As
                  one of the oldest historical territories of Britain, Ireland’s
                  relationship with its neighbour is complex. British rule had
                  drastic effects on Ireland’s language, ethnicity, faith and
                  class system. Whilst in the past, British colonialists
                  insisted on the absolute and hierarchical difference between
                  themselves and the Native Irish, the idea that today, when it
                  concerns successful Irish people, they can be neatly subsumed
                  into British identity is anathema to many Irish people and
                  provokes a visceral response.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When it comes to the question of British art, and of who can
                  be classified as a British artist, from an Irish perspective
                  this is controversial. In the sixteenth and seventeenth
                  centuries, British art was dominated by successful foreigners.
                  But from the 1730s Hogarth flourished and became a dominant
                  figure, followed by Gainsborough, Reynolds, Turner, Constable
                  and Blake—each of whom ranks among the most original geniuses
                  of British art. However, if we go solely by nationality, two
                  of the great British history painters, James Barry and Daniel
                  Maclise, were both Irish-born. The three towering figures of
                  twentieth-century British figurative painting, Lucian Freud,
                  Frank Auerbach and Francis Bacon, were all born outside
                  Britain. Yet all these artists fall within the category of
                  British art. In an era of globalisation and multiculturalism,
                  is the use of the label “British art” anachronistic? Does it
                  promulgate a sense of exclusivity rather than inclusivity?
                  Undoubtedly, the question prompts a contentious debate, but
                  can it not also be a progressive one that encourages us to
                  explore the contemporary importance of national boundaries and
                  identities in terms of art? One important and positive step is
                  the acknowledgement of a nation’s complex history, and open
                  debate and discussion in forums such as this are to be
                  welcomed.

                  The history of the
                  <a href="#http-www-hughlane-ie" target="_blank">Hugh Lane Gallery</a>, Dublin, neatly encapsulates the conundrum of Ireland’s
                  relationship with Britain. And given the
                  <a href="#http-www-theguardian-com-world-2015-may-26-national-gallery-disputed-art-collection-belongs-to-ireland-sir-hugh-lane" target="_blank">current arrangement</a>
                  of the 39 Lane paintings shared with the National Gallery,
                  London, it is one that still resonates. The founder, Hugh Lane
                  (1875–1915) was born in Ireland, brought up in Britain and
                  lived in London, where he became a highly successful art
                  dealer and collector. Lane embarked on a mission to provide
                  access for the Irish public to international art and to
                  promote a distinctive school of Irish art. In late 1904, he
                  offered his art collection to the city of Dublin and garnered
                  the support of an eclectic group of individuals, including
                  nationalists, unionists, artists, poets, journalists and
                  scientists, to assist in the foundation of a gallery of modern
                  art. Lane received a knighthood in the King’s Birthday Honours
                  in 1909 for his services to Irish art. When the gallery opened
                  in temporary premises in 1908, it was grouped by school—Room I
                  was “Irish Painters (by birth or descent)” and Room II
                  “British School”. This arrangement was significant given that
                  it pre-dated Ireland becoming an independent state in 1922.

                  One of the most significant acquisitions of recent times is
                  the studio of the Dublin-born artist
                  <a href="#http-www-hughlane-ie-history-of-studio-relocation" target="_blank">Francis Bacon</a>. It has inevitably raised the question of whether Bacon is
                  an Irish or British artist. Since 2006 the gallery has also
                  had a permanent display of paintings by Sean Scully. He was
                  also born in Dublin, but left Ireland at the age of four when
                  his family emigrated for financial reasons. Whilst Scully
                  spent his formative years in England, he strongly asserts his
                  Irish identity. Conversely, the collection also includes
                  British artists who have settled in Ireland, such as Nick
                  Miller, Hughie O’Donoghue and Barrie Cooke.

                  A recent exhibition of the work of the father of British Pop
                  Art, Richard Hamilton, and his partner, Rita Donagh, at the
                  Hugh Lane Gallery highlights the independence of thought of
                  some artists, regardless of nationality. “<a href="#http-www-hughlane-ie-past-413-civil-rights-etc" target="_blank">Civil Rights etc.</a>” was to be Hamilton’s final exhibition. Both artists tackled
                  the difficult subject of Northern Ireland, but whilst Donagh
                  has Irish roots, Hamilton was an English artist looking at
                  Ireland from outside. His iconic work
                  <a href="#http-www-tate-org-uk-art-artworks-hamilton-the-citizen-t03980" target="_blank"><em>The Citizen</em></a>
                  (1981–83, Tate Collection) is based on an image of a prisoner
                  on a ‘dirty protest’ in the Maze (Long Kesh) prison in
                  Northern Ireland. In this case, the artist’s emotional
                  response to a situation overrides neat categorisation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is tempting to subscribe to Whistler’s statement, “There is
                  no such thing as English art. You might as well talk of
                  English mathematics! Art is art and mathematics is
                  mathematics.” To my mind, it is more interesting to questionn
                  and debate the character of British art, rather than come to
                  narrow definitions. It can be explorative rather than
                  definitive, inclusive rather than exclusive in scope.
                </p>
                <h1 id="e2-80-9cto-understand-british-art-as-an-artist-2c-learn-to-know-your-place-e2-80-9d" tabindex="-1">
                  “To understand British art as an artist, learn to know your
                  place.”
                </h1>
                <p>
                  There is certainly such a thing as British art; it is
                  contained and restrained, boxed and categorised but not fixed;
                  still fluid.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To understand British art as an artist, learn to know your
                  place. It is certainly fashioned on the British class system
                  but is not an exact model. There are artist equivalents of
                  self-assured aristocrats, military men, visiting diplomats,
                  society women, all of whom seem to know each other and who can
                  often be seen gently, easily moving to and fro, encouraging
                  and reassuring each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are thousands of busy and eager-to-please strivers,
                  making marvellous work of quality but who must earn their
                  living supporting the intricate infrastructures hidden in the
                  corridors of power.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then there are the artist equivalents of the desperate, the
                  homeless and the poorly educated, who have never been taught
                  that all is not what it seems. They do not know that critics,
                  curators and collectors are human beings who form friendships
                  with artists; who sometimes go on holiday together, have
                  dinner together and live in the same streets in the same
                  cities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  British art is fully able and happy to be critical of the
                  questionable political structures and falsely constructed art
                  histories which underpin it. At the same time it rewards and
                  seeks to celebrate an entitlement of belonging. An acceptable
                  art work may demonstrate a sophisticated awareness of both the
                  inevitable magnificence and unavoidable hysteria of work made
                  anywhere else.
                </p>
                <p>
                  British Art is slightly flawed, casually disciplined, still
                  and patient, hard-working with plenty of sweat and dirt, grey
                  and brown. Greys: warm and light infused with yellow, or dark
                  and icy with blue running through. Browns: laced with
                  burgundy, or verging on green or leaning softly on the edge of
                  orange.
                </p>
                <p>
                  British Art speaks English well and acknowledges the
                  importance of English literature and history, the Scottish and
                  Welsh landscape, German classical music, French food and wine,
                  Italian ice cream and architecture, Spanish painters,
                  Brazilian heat, American men and Irish hospitality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is within it, a few of us think, some potential room for
                  manoeuvre."

                  In the competitive environment of the eighteenth-century
                  London art scene, Thomas Gainsborough and Sir Joshua Reynolds
                  were often perceived as great rivals. While they shared
                  patrons, sitters, and a stake in the future of British art,
                  their differing artistic approaches caused considerable
                  friction, indeed Gainsborough seceded from the Royal Academy
                  of Art in 1784, boycotting its exhibitions and activities.
                  This essay, however, argues that Gainsborough’s* Charity
                  Relieving Distress*, painted in the year of his secession,
                  proposes a charitable resolution of their aesthetic attitudes.
                  The complex interrelation of allegorical and anecdotal form is
                  interpreted as a pictorial attempt to reconcile their
                  approaches through the concept of charity, a virtue of
                  powerful artistic lineage in the western tradition, and of
                  contemporary social importance*.

                <p>
                  In 1784, the celebrated painter Thomas Gainsborough did two
                  remarkable things: he seceded from exhibitions of the Royal
                  Academy of Arts, and he painted
                  <em>Charity Relieving Distress</em> (<a href="#gcole-fig1">fig. 1</a>). Although invited to join the Academy as one of its
                  inaugural members in 1768, Gainsborough’s relationship with
                  the institution and its president, Sir Joshua Reynolds, was
                  both distant and conflicted. From 1773 to 1776 he boycotted
                  its yearly exhibitions, complaining of the way his paintings
                  were displayed, and in April 1784, after another quarrel with
                  the hanging committee, withdrew all his works from the
                  exhibition.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;For the next three years, Gainsborough absented himself from
                  the Academy’s operations and showed his works, not at the
                  official, annual exhibitions at Somerset House, but privately
                  in his painting room at Schomberg House, Pall Mall.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;The press followed the row with alacrity, contributing to
                  the public perception of Gainsborough’s temperamental
                  eccentricity, and the rivalry between him and Reynolds.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the dispute was ostensibly over the placement of his
                  portraits of the royal family, it can also be read as the
                  culmination of Gainsborough’s long-standing ambivalence
                  towards the authority of the institution and its ideas about
                  art. Exhibited at Schomberg House three months after his
                  much-publicized break with Britain’s first, and much awaited,
                  crown-chartered institution of art,
                  <em>Charity Relieving Distress</em> may be interpreted in
                  relation to Gainsborough’s complex relation to its theoretical
                  programme. Through subject, compositional structure, and
                  iconography, it challenges the hierarchy of artistic modes
                  adopted by the fledgling institution. In place of political
                  invective, however, <em>Charity Relieving Distress</em> seems
                  to propose, through the deliberate interrelation of
                  allegorical and anecdotal forms, a charitable resolution
                  between the higher and lower genres of painting as they were
                  set forth in Reynolds’s <em>Discourses</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Painted in luminous glazes and rich colour,
                  <em>Charity Relieving Distress</em> depicts a young woman
                  dispensing food to a ragged family in front of a townhouse. On
                  the stairs below the group, a solitary male figure looks on
                  with admiration at the spectacle of benevolence, and on the
                  left hand side, a third woman is seated on the ground by a
                  loaded mule. The house, forming an architectural backdrop to
                  the event, is ornamented with vines and doves roost on its
                  eaves, and the whole scene is suffused with light from the
                  upper left, which bathes the figures in golden evanescence. In
                  subject and style, <em>Charity Relieving Distress</em> is an
                  idealized image of private and spontaneous benevolence, in
                  which the wealthy share the excesses of the table with those
                  in need. What we see today, however, is but a fragment of the
                  original work, which was significantly cut down sometime in
                  the nineteenth century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>&nbsp;A copy made after the original by the artist’s nephew and
                  apprentice, Gainsborough Dupont (ca. 1784;
                  <a href="#gcole-fig2">fig. 2</a>), as well as a mezzotint by
                  Richard Banks Harraden published in 1801, more than a decade
                  after Gainsborough’s death (<a href="#gcole-fig3">fig. 3</a>),
                  reveal that the painting was initially much larger, with a
                  more extensive compositional and iconographical programme. The
                  act of charity was specifically located within the doorway of
                  the house, which, decorated with an ornate pediment and a
                  crest, was once an imposing motif.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>&nbsp;Beside it, two finely dressed young women, presumably
                  daughters of the house, were placed as additional spectators
                  to the giving of alms. On the left-hand side, a large archway
                  balanced the open door, and the loaded mule was driven through
                  it by a bowed figure mounted on a donkey, past the woman
                  seated on the ground.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>&nbsp;Conferring religious approbation on charitable giving, a
                  square-towered Gothic church presided over the scene.

                  When the painting was exhibited at Schomberg House in July
                  1784, Henry Bate-Dudley, champion of Gainsborough and editor
                  of the <em>Morning Herald</em>, catalogued these details,
                  providing a useful description of the painting:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    This picture consists of an elegant building, in one of the
                    approaches to which, is an ascent of steps, and at a
                    distance an arch, through which a loaded mule is passing.
                    The principal objects are a beggar-woman, who is receiving
                    relief from a female servant belonging to the house. The
                    beggar has an infant in her arms, and one on her back, and
                    is also surrounded by others: some of whom, appear terrified
                    at a dog who will not suffer their approach to the House.—
                    Two children, on the steps of the door are represented
                    making observations on the circumstance. A very fine summer
                    sky is introduced. A vine is represented against the side of
                    the house; several pigeons also are described fluttering
                    about the building. The whole of which forms a beautiful
                    assemblage of an interesting nature.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Bate-Dudley itemizes many of the components of Gainsborough’s
                  painting, and is an important guide for the modern viewer.
                  Some details, however, seem to be hastily observed, or only
                  vaguely remembered. The charitable woman is called a servant,
                  but the similarity of her clothing to that worn by the young
                  ladies in the doorway, as well as her proximity to them,
                  suggest she could well be a member of the wealthy family.
                  Moreover, Harraden’s mezzotint was dedicated to “the Nobility
                  and Gentry, Whose Humane exertions are employed in alleviating
                  the distresses of the Poor”, interpreting the benevolent young
                  woman as a member of the family to whom the house belongs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>&nbsp;In addition, the dog that seemed so threatening crouches in
                  a pose of friendly interest characteristic of Gainsborough’s
                  paintings, and the children pay him little attention.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite these discrepancies, Bate-Dudley’s description of the
                  painting as a “beautiful assemblage of an interesting nature”
                  evokes the original complexity of Gainsborough’s picture, and
                  allows one to broach the work’s sophisticated narrative and
                  aesthetic meanings. By way of his review, Dupont’s copy, and
                  Harraden’s print, the compositional and iconographical
                  programme of Gainsborough’s painting may be reconstructed and
                  interpreted, particularly in connection to debates about the
                  nature and future of art in Britain. Through the elaborate
                  architectural setting, especially the use of doorways and
                  threshold spaces, Gainsborough’s painting aligns with
                  contemporary conceptions of charity as a form of benevolent
                  exchange, a mediating disposition that forms ideal
                  relationships between individuals and allows access to the
                  heavenly realm. Furthermore, through the self-conscious mixing
                  of allegorical and anecdotal forms, the idea of charity as a
                  mediating social virtue is extended to issues of aesthetic
                  politics; indeed, the painting seems to offer the prospect of
                  a benevolent reconciliation between high and low forms of art.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This argument builds upon Martin Postle’s ingenious
                  realization that in painting the beggar family, Gainsborough
                  drew on Reynolds’s personification of Charity for the New
                  College Chapel window at Oxford University.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>&nbsp;While Postle used this identification to stress the
                  religious meanings of Gainsborough’s painting, I would like to
                  add a further layer of interpretation by suggesting that
                  Gainsborough depicts two figures of charity: an allegorical
                  one and an anecdotal one, which, in their benevolent
                  encounter, propose a charitable reconciliation between the
                  general and the particular, the visual vocabularies of history
                  painting, promoted by Reynolds, and the “fancy picture” genre

                  Though the competitive relationship between Reynolds and
                  Gainsborough has been widely addressed, this article examines
                  the ways in which Gainsborough negotiated the theoretical
                  principles espoused by the president in his own art
                  practice.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>&nbsp;It identifies a distinctly pictorial attempt by Gainsborough
                  to reconcile their divergent approaches through the concept of
                  charity, a virtue of powerful artistic lineage in the western
                  tradition, and of contemporary social importance. This
                  approach is indebted to the interpretative framework of
                  Gainsborough scholars Ann Bermingham, Michael Rosenthal, and
                  Amal Asfour and Paul Williamson, who have examined his oeuvre
                  in relation to questions of aesthetic ideology and
                  contemporary sociability.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>&nbsp;Bermingham’s important exhibition and book,
                  <em>Sensation and Sensibility: Viewing Gainsborough’s Cottage
                    Door</em>
                  (2005), which included essays by Rosenthal and Asfour and
                  Williamson, considered the Cottage Door paintings as
                  ambitious, emotive subject pictures that challenged
                  conventions of public art and academic tradition and
                  contributed to the visualization of the modes of seeing and
                  feeling specific to sensibility.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  Indeed, Bermingham and Rosenthal’s contributions to this book
                  are part of a long-standing exploration of the modernity of
                  Gainsborough’s art, its critical position in relation to the
                  civic humanist tradition of academic art theory, its
                  engagement with contemporary culture, and its response to a
                  growing middle-class audience.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>

                  The present article likewise takes
                  <em>Charity Relieving Distress</em> as visual evidence of
                  Gainsborough’s attitudes to academic painting and his own
                  ambitions for the direction of British art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>&nbsp;Despite the charm of the painting’s subject, and its
                  fanciful combination of buildings and figures, it has a very
                  real message that relates pointedly to the hierarchy of forms
                  established in Reynolds’s <em>Discourses on Art</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>&nbsp;In adopting the charitable imagery of contemporary morality,
                  Gainsborough’s painting deliberately stages a reconciliation
                  of the allegorical and the observed, offering an “argument in
                  paint” for a composite formulation of morally serious art
                  fitted to a commercial and benevolent age.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Charity was a crucial subject and practice in the development
                  of eighteenth-century British art. It was the basis of one of
                  the earliest, semi-public exhibitions of painting and
                  sculpture in London, at Thomas Coram’s Foundling Hospital in
                  1747, a key attempt, led by William Hogarth, to foster a
                  national, modern school. The exhibition was designed to
                  attract patrons to the institution (and the exhibiting
                  artists) and mingled the display of art with the humanitarian
                  culture of charitable giving. It also provided an opportunity
                  to show ambitious art on religious themes in the absence of
                  patronage from the Church or state.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>&nbsp;Hogarth, Francis Hayman, Joseph Highmore, and James Wills
                  contributed large-scale biblical subjects on charitable
                  themes, and John Michael Rysbrack sculpted an allegory of
                  Charity and a marble frieze. Gainsborough himself contributed
                  a roundel of the building to the exhibition, early evidence of
                  his association with the St Martin’s Lane Academy and the
                  empirical, modern approach to painting advocated by Hogarth,
                  Hubert Gravelot, and Hayman.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>

                  Charity remained, in the latter half of the century, one of
                  the most enduringly popular subjects of British art. From the
                  1760s on, remarkable numbers of paintings and prints on
                  charitable themes were exhibited at the Society of Artists and
                  the Royal Academy.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>&nbsp;Edward Penny’s
                  <em>The Marquis of Granby giving Alms to a Sick Soldier and his
                    Family</em>
                  (1764; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford), exhibited at the Society of
                  Artists in 1765, proved so successful that he made three
                  autograph versions and marketed a mezzotint engraved by
                  Richard Houston.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup>&nbsp;Paintings of charity were also exhibited at the Royal
                  Academy of Arts by Johann Zoffany, who showed his
                  <em>Beggars on the Road to Stanmore</em> in 1771 (private
                  collection), and Penny’s student, William Redmore Bigg, who
                  was praised for his sentimental scenes of benevolence, such
                  <em>Schoolboys Giving Charity to a Blind Man</em>, exhibited
                  in 1780 (location unknown), and
                  <em>A Lady and Her Children Relieving a Cottager</em> of 1781
                  (Philadelphia Museum of Art).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">22</a></sup>&nbsp;These paintings and prints answered the call for moralizing
                  imagery made by critics such as Vicesimus Knox, who argued in
                  his <em>Essays</em> of 1778 that painting, by depicting
                  benevolent acts, “may be rendered something more than an
                  elegant mode of pleasing the eye and the imagination; it may
                  become a very powerful auxiliary of virtue”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">23</a></sup>&nbsp;In their idealized depictions of benevolence to the
                  deserving poor, these accessible portraits and fancy pictures
                  mobilized the everyday for the purposes of moral edification
                  and sentimental satisfaction.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">24</a></sup>

                  In depicting the giving of alms in everyday situations with
                  recognizable contemporary figures, paintings by Penny,
                  Zoffany, and Bigg revised the allegorical image of Charity
                  that dominated the old-master tradition. Charity, in
                  allegorical guise, was traditionally represented as a
                  breast-feeding mother embracing two children.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">25</a></sup>&nbsp;According to Cesare Ripa’s influential compendium of
                  allegories and personifications, <em>Iconologia</em> of 1611,
                  the children represent Faith and Hope, who Charity nurtures,
                  and the image forms a Christian allegory of maternal and
                  divine devotion (<a href="#gcole-fig4">fig. 4</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">26</a></sup>&nbsp;The allegorical image of Charity was well represented in
                  English collections at mid-century; an Anthony van Dyck
                  <em>Charity</em> (ca. 1627–8;
                  <a href="#gcole-fig5">fig. 5</a>), which depicts a woman in
                  red robes embracing several children, was in the collection of
                  the Earl of Lonsdale by 1763, and the Duke of Devonshire
                  possessed Carlo Cignani’s <em>Charity</em> (private
                  collection), which was engraved by Simon Ravenet after a
                  drawing by John Hamilton Mortimer in the same year.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">27</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the allegorical tradition continued to inform
                  eighteenth-century paintings of charity, as the example of
                  Reynolds will attest, on the whole, benevolence was
                  increasingly represented in terms of contemporary British
                  experience. This contemporary reworking of the theme can be
                  linked to the influence of Hogarth’s pioneering “modern moral
                  subjects”. This “intermediate species of subjects”, drawn from
                  the common incidents and customs of urban life, mingled the
                  strategies of comic Northern genre painting and the high moral
                  seriousness of classicist history painting to “entertain and
                  improve the mind”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">28</a></sup>&nbsp;While eschewing the satire of Hogarth’s approach, modern
                  painters of charity from the 1760s onwards, Gainsborough
                  included, took advantage of his re-invention of moralizing
                  subjects by using the familiar spaces and figures of
                  contemporary British life. Indeed these paintings of everyday
                  benevolence can be connected to the increasing importance of
                  “social” virtues in contemporary British society and what John
                  Barrell has termed the “attenuation” of the discourse of civic
                  humanism in moral philosophy and art. Aimed at an audience of
                  private individuals, modern charitable subjects promoted the
                  softer virtues of an increasingly commercial age, such as
                  generosity, kindness, amiability, liberality, and
                  compassion.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">29</a></sup>&nbsp;In representing civil ideals of humanity and benevolence,
                  pictures of charity could in this sense atone, at least at the
                  level of representation, for the deleterious social effects of
                  commerce and industrialization.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">30</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artists were thus responding in pictorial ways to the
                  contemporary interest in the practice of almsgiving and the
                  moral virtues of compassion and benevolence.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">31</a></sup>&nbsp;As Samuel Johnson rather drily put it, “no sooner is a new
                  species of misery brought to view, and a design of relieving
                  it professed, than every hand is open to contribute something,
                  every tongue is busied in solicitation, and every art of
                  pleasure is employed for a time in the interest of
                  virtue.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">32</a></sup>&nbsp;Charity is in many ways the primary social virtue of the
                  eighteenth century, enshrined as a Christian duty, a social
                  necessity, and a demonstration of sympathetic feeling. In
                  1752, Henry Fielding claimed it to be “the very characteristic
                  of this Nation at this Time”. “I believe”, he wrote, “we may
                  challenge the whole World to parallel the Examples which we
                  have late given of this sensible, this noble, this Christian
                  Virtue.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">33</a></sup>&nbsp;Johnson, in a 1758 edition of <em>The Idler</em>, rather
                  agreed, conceding, “the present age, though not likely to
                  shine hereafter among the most splendid periods of history,
                  has yet given examples of charity, which may be very properly
                  recommended to imitation.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">34</a></sup>&nbsp;The moralist Hannah More crowned the century as “the Age of
                  Benevolence” in 1791, affirming the popular conception of
                  Britain as a charitable nation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">35</a></sup>

                  This atmosphere of self-congratulation was in some measure
                  justified by the unusual provisions made for the poor in
                  English law and the rise of humanitarian institutions. Unique
                  in Europe, England possessed a parish-based, tax-funded
                  structure of relief for the destitute.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">36</a></sup>&nbsp;In addition, rising numbers of “associated charities” were
                  founded to assist particular groups of needy individuals.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">37</a></sup>&nbsp;Inspired by the success of the joint-stock economic
                  enterprise, many entrepreneurial Britons took part in
                  philanthropic ventures funded by private subscription and
                  managed by committee.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">38</a></sup>&nbsp;Charities such as the Foundling Hospital, chartered in 1739
                  to house, feed, and educate “exposed and deserted young
                  children”; the British Lying-In Hospital “for delivering poor
                  married women”, established in 1749; and the Magdalen House
                  “for the reception of reformed and penitent prostitutes”,
                  founded in 1758, complemented and critiqued the provisions of
                  the poor laws, generating a modern humanitarian culture that
                  mingled personal benevolence with a sense of public duty.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">39</a></sup>&nbsp;Eschewing traditional notions of aristocratic benevolence,
                  charity in the eighteenth century was increasingly the purview
                  of a morally anxious middle class that aimed to improve the
                  health and condition of the distressed, and fortify moral
                  virtue.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">40</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rather than a simple matter of giving alms, however, charity
                  in the eighteenth century was also understood as an ideal
                  relationship between oneself and one’s fellows. Summing up its
                  many personal and social manifestations, the popular
                  Presbyterian preacher Dr Hugh Blair described charity as:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    the comforter of the afflicted, the protector of the
                    oppressed, the reconciler of differences, the intercessor
                    for offenders. It is faithfulness in the friend, public
                    spirit in the magistrate, equity and patience in the judge,
                    moderation in the sovereign, and loyalty in the subject.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">41</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  As Blair suggests, charity is a disposition of generosity and
                  compassion that permeates all levels of social life and
                  establishes a contract of reciprocity between the enfranchised
                  and those in need. Joseph Addison said as much in 1711, when
                  he wrote in <em>The Spectator</em> that charity was the
                  practical application of “Good-Will or Benevolence, in the
                  Soul”, and that “Gifts and Alms are the Expressions, not the
                  Essence of this Virtue.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">42</a></sup>&nbsp;Voicing a similar attitude, Johnson, in the first edition of
                  his <em>Dictionary of the English Language</em>, defined the
                  primary meanings of charity as “tenderness; kindness; love”,
                  and “goodwill; benevolence; disposition to think well of
                  others”, putting “liberality to the poor” and “alms, relief
                  given to the poor” as the last of his definitions of the
                  term.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">43</a></sup>&nbsp;Blair, Addison, and Johnson suggest that charity in the
                  eighteenth century entailed a mode of being as well as an act
                  of giving. The Christian virtue of charity constituted
                  love—for God, and for one’s neighbour.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">44</a></sup>&nbsp;As the animating principle of Christianity, and foremost of
                  Faith and Hope among the three Christian virtues, Charity
                  formed an ideal attitude of openness to the plight of others,
                  and established the spiritual foundation for more practical
                  forms of assistance.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">45</a></sup>&nbsp;In its more secular application, it was the love, kindness,
                  and generosity that mediated and moderated relationships
                  between self and other.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">46</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  For Gainsborough, charity was a vital social virtue, inspired
                  by his quickness of feeling for other human beings. Defending
                  the state of his finances in a letter to his sister, Mary
                  Gibbon, he insisted “as God is my Judge, I do what I do more
                  from Charity and human feelings than my other
                  Gratifycations.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">47</a></sup>
                  His biographer, Philip Thicknesse, confirmed his generosity,
                  publishing accounts of his benevolence in the
                  <em>St James’s Chronicle</em> and his
                  <em>Sketch of the Life and Paintings of Thomas Gainsborough</em>
                  at his death in August 1788.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">48</a></sup>&nbsp;Recalling his attempts to secure a subscription for a
                  gentlewoman and her child impoverished by the suicide of her
                  husband, Thicknesse congratulated Gainsborough on his
                  immediate and generous response, claiming that despite his
                  tendencies as a “Humourist”, his “susceptible mind and his
                  benevolent heart, led him into such repeated acts of
                  generosity”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">49</a></sup>&nbsp;In keeping with this biographical portrait, an obituary
                  published in the <em>Morning Chronicle</em> in 1788 asked that
                  a “tear be shed in affection for that generous heart, whose
                  strongest proprieties were to relieve the claims of poverty,
                  wherever they appeared genuine!”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">50</a></sup>&nbsp;As a man with an “indisputed reputation of strong
                  sensibility”, charity was the necessary expression of
                  Gainsborough’s emotional sensitivity to the sufferings of
                  others.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">51</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Considered in this context, Gainsborough’s
                  <em>Charity Relieving Distress</em> appears to draw
                  deliberately on the eighteenth-century practice and conception
                  of charity. Firstly, in positioning the giving of alms at the
                  doorway of the townhouse, the painting reflects the importance
                  of doors as sites of benevolence in eighteenth-century London,
                  as well as the idea of charity as an act of compassionate
                  exchange. In a 1752 pamphlet on poverty and the poor laws, the
                  clergyman Thomas Alcock included church doors among the sites
                  at which mendicants accumulated. Beggars, he claimed, “take
                  their stand at the Corners of Streets, or the Doors of
                  Temples, at any public Places of Passage or Resort, in order
                  to make their Distress more known, and move the Charity of
                  Travellers, Passengers, or Worshippers, by a view of their
                  pitiable case”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">52</a></sup>&nbsp;Likewise, domestic doors were also popular places to
                  petition for alms. In his <em>Covent-Garden Journal</em>,
                  Fielding remarked upon the “immense numbers of beggars who
                  frequent our streets, and are to be found at almost every
                  door”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53">53</a></sup>&nbsp;Traditionally, a woman or child would knock at the door of a
                  house requesting money, employment, or some food. As Tim
                  Hitchcock has shown, the ritual of knocking for charity and
                  “charring” for alms survived undiminished into the eighteenth
                  century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54">54</a></sup>&nbsp;In this sense, doors formed regular places for charity,
                  sites of sometimes sudden and unsolicited contact between the
                  affluent and the indigent. Forming thresholds between social
                  classes and the spaces they inhabited, doors frequently
                  demarcated an area in which rich and poor made contact through
                  charitable exchange.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55">55</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Gainsborough, however, expands the architectural iconography
                  of charity by using doors and passageways to position the act
                  of almsgiving in a larger in-between space. On the right-hand
                  side of the scene, the door of the house opens into the
                  interior of the wealthy abode, and on the left-hand side, an
                  archway leads into the town. This area, framed by the two
                  apertures, is extended into a stage-like space. Elevated by
                  the set of stairs and flanked by entrances and exits, it
                  provides a kind of theatrical setting for the charitable act,
                  replete with a seated audience member. Moreover, the paired
                  doors and arches allow the mediating qualities of charity to
                  be evocatively portrayed.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56">56</a></sup>&nbsp;Through this arrangement of figures and spaces, Gainsborough
                  depicts the act of charity as an ideal exchange between social
                  classes. Separated from the beggar family by the line of the
                  stoep, the benevolent young woman reaches over this boundary
                  to tip food into the upturned hat of the young boy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On each side of this dividing line, different social spheres
                  are constructed. Behind the beggar family, the mounted figure
                  travelling through the archway and the indigent woman seated
                  on the ground evoke the increasing movement of the poor as a
                  result of the enclosure of commons and development of agrarian
                  capitalism.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57">57</a></sup>&nbsp;In the doorway of the great house, the elegant pair by the
                  balustrade represents the stability and comfort of privilege.
                  Transgressing the line that distinguishes indigence from
                  affluence, and public space from private property, the young
                  woman makes contact with the poor family through her act of
                  charity. Only she transcends the boundary between wealth and
                  poverty, fortune and misfortune, connecting the two sides of
                  the composition and momentarily uniting its opposed social
                  groups.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58">58</a></sup>&nbsp;The whiteness of the plate directly between them
                  additionally focuses the viewer’s attention on this point of
                  intersection, and the reaching arms of the standing girl and
                  infant child, which mirror the outstretched curve of the young
                  lady’s arm, reinforce the physical contact taking place
                  between giver and receiver. Her act of charity is thus
                  represented as a gesture that transcends spatial and social
                  boundaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Secondly, this moment of charitable contact is also extended
                  metaphorically between earthly and heavenly domains.
                  Fluttering about the eaves of the house, several doves roost
                  and strut. A lone dove, however, has taken to the air and is
                  captured with wings aloft, directly above the act of charity.
                  Looking down upon the figural group, the dove seems to be
                  transformed from an ordinary, ungainly pigeon into a
                  suggestion of the Holy Spirit, positioned to crown the giving
                  of alms as an act of divine virtue.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59">59</a></sup>&nbsp;Picked out in opaque greys and whites, this dove is more
                  defined than its fellows, and the surrounding pentimenti
                  indicate that Gainsborough took some care with its
                  positioning.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60">60</a></sup>&nbsp;Illuminated by a clear, warm light, the dove is located
                  above the infant in the woman’s arms, who is made Christ-like
                  by their alignment. Poised delicately over their heads,
                  looking down on the exchange, the dove is the uppermost part
                  of this central narrative group and invokes the religious
                  approbation of charity, the presence of godliness in
                  benevolence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through its iconography, Gainsborough’s picture engages with
                  the religious conception of charity as access to the spiritual
                  world. Not only did charity mediate between self and other,
                  but it was also imagined to form a link between the believer
                  and the deity. As the Reverend Philip Barton told his
                  congregation in 1736, “Charity unites us to God; it makes us a
                  Part of the divine Image, and gives us the Resemblance of his
                  Supreme Perfections.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61">61</a></sup>&nbsp;Likewise, in a 1761 sermon, the Reverend Ebenezer Radcliff
                  stressed the contact charity established between sinner and
                  redeemer, preaching that charity “draws down the blessing of
                  God upon our temporal concerns”, and “brings us the nearest to
                  the sublime character of the God of all perfection”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn62" id="fnref62">62</a></sup>&nbsp;Charity thus formed a web of connection, both between humans
                  on earth, and between the mortal and divine realms.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn63" id="fnref63">63</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Within Gainsborough’s painting, the charitable act seems
                  indeed to “draw down the blessing of God”, creating a kind of
                  spiritual contact between the mortal world and the heavenly
                  realm.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn64" id="fnref64">64</a></sup>&nbsp;Here, both giver and receiver have a rough equivalence in
                  terms of compositional structure; the benevolent giver is
                  placed no higher than those she relieves, nor do the grateful
                  beggars kneel to receive her bounty. Rather, it is the dove
                  above their heads that takes precedence, and shows that
                  Gainsborough’s spatial hierarchy is not based upon the
                  dictates of social class, but upon spiritual virtue. On this
                  vertical axis, the dove invokes a connection between the
                  unseen divine world above, and the earthly one below. Rising
                  atmospherically into the clouds, the church tower in the
                  background reinforces the dove’s spiritual allusions. In
                  Gainsborough’s picture, the giving of alms to the distressed
                  mediates horizontally between human beings and social spaces,
                  and vertically between earthly virtue and divine reward.

                  Gainsborough’s two charities
                </h1>
                <p>
                  Gainsborough’s construction of ideal, mediating relationships
                  between social classes and between heaven and earth has,
                  however, a further level of significance. The composition of
                  the painting, its spatial motifs and iconographical
                  references, not only gesture to charity’s role as an ideal
                  form of exchange between affluent and indigent, and the
                  earthly and the divine, but also to its mediation of different
                  approaches to the art of painting. Addressed in terms of
                  eighteenth-century art theory, the painting can be viewed as
                  an attempt to depict a compassionate and benevolent resolution
                  between the visual vocabularies of history painting and the
                  fancy picture. Alongside the dove, which shifts from being an
                  ordinary pigeon into an image of the Holy Spirit, other
                  figures in Gainsborough’s painting take on powerful
                  allegorical meanings. Recently, Postle has suggested that the
                  mother draped with children, whom Bate-Dudley described as a
                  “beggar woman”, is in fact an allegorical figure of
                  Charity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn65" id="fnref65">65</a></sup>&nbsp;Postle founds this interpretation upon the striking
                  similarities between Gainsborough’s figural group and Joshua
                  Reynolds’s <em>Charity</em> (ca. 1779;
                  <a href="#gcole-fig6">figs. 6</a>&nbsp;and
                  <a href="#gcole-fig7">7</a>), one of a number of Christian
                  virtues designed for the New College Chapel window at Oxford
                  University (<a href="#gcole-fig8">fig. 8</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn66" id="fnref66">66</a></sup>&nbsp;While the final product was to be painted directly onto the
                  windowpanes by the glass painter Thomas Jervais, Reynolds did
                  not waste the opportunity to exhibit his designs, working the
                  panels up into finished paintings of the Christian virtues for
                  the Royal Academy exhibition of 1779.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn67" id="fnref67">67</a></sup>

                  Reynolds here borrowed from the allegorical depiction of
                  Charity in Renaissance and seventeenth-century art, in which
                  she is personified as a woman nursing or embracing several
                  children. The artist was well versed in this tradition; on his
                  tour of Italy in 1752, he recorded seeing “a Charity by Guido”
                  in the Pitti Palace, most probably Guido Reni’s
                  <em>Charity</em>, of 1624–5 in the Palazzo Pitti in Florence
                  (<a href="#gcole-fig9">fig. 9</a>), which includes the basic
                  elements of Ripa’s model, showing a cloaked woman
                  breastfeeding an infant and embracing another while a third
                  leans over her shoulder.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn68" id="fnref68">68</a></sup>&nbsp;As Francis Broun has shown, he also owned a small oil sketch
                  on panel of part of a lost <em>Charity</em> by Van Dyck,
                  either by Van Dyck’s hand or his own.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn69" id="fnref69">69</a></sup>&nbsp;He made characteristic use of this model in his 1773
                  portrait of
                  <em>Lady Cockburn and Her Three Eldest Sons</em> (<a href="#gcole-fig10">fig. 10)</a>, showing a seated Augusta embracing her three young boys in
                  a similar arrangement to that used by Van Dyck.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn70" id="fnref70">70</a></sup>&nbsp;The Cockburn painting may also have been modelled on a large
                  Caritas drawing in ink by Jan de Bisschop (Morgan Library and
                  Museum, New York) of a seated woman in an architectural
                  setting surrounded by children that was in the artist’s own
                  collection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn71" id="fnref71">71</a></sup>&nbsp;Drawing yet again upon this iconographic model, Reynolds’s
                  life-size personification of Charity for the New College
                  window emphasizes its Christian and maternal aspects: against
                  a swirling background of atmospheric clouds, a young woman
                  holds an infant to her breast, clasps another around the
                  middle, and looks tenderly down on a third who holds onto her
                  waist and leans back to look up into her face.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn72" id="fnref72">72</a></sup>

                <p>
                  While not so steeped in the allegorical tradition,
                  Gainsborough’s oeuvre also indicates an interest in the
                  personification of Charity. An undated trois crayons drawing,
                  probably from the 1780s, depicts a seated woman with three
                  children of different ages, forming an intertwined figural
                  group. Although the figures are in contemporary dress, the
                  composition has a striking similarity to the allegorical
                  Charity of art-historical tradition, which would have been
                  familiar to Gainsborough, at the very least through Rysbrack’s
                  marble bas-relief for the Foundling Hospital.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn73" id="fnref73">73</a></sup>&nbsp;In <em>Charity Relieving Distress</em>, however, the
                  allegorical nature of the figure is beyond question, as is its
                  emulation of Reynolds’s work. Like Reynolds’s
                  <em>Charity</em>, Gainsborough’s standing female figure is
                  draped with children, although hers seem slightly younger: the
                  child on her back and the baby in her arms are only infants.
                  The small boy, hanging from his mother’s waistband and holding
                  his foot in the air, however, appears to have been lifted
                  directly from Reynolds’s painting. A preparatory drawing for
                  <em>Charity Relieving Distress</em>, sold at auction in 2004,
                  suggests that Gainsborough developed the figural grouping so
                  that it emulated Reynolds’s painting more closely (<a href="#gcole-fig11">fig. 11</a>). While the initial sketch depicts the same number of
                  figures, they are more closely arranged, and the boy at the
                  edge of the group only peeps around her skirts. In the final
                  painting, he separated the children receiving alms from the
                  mother and her infants and reworked the left-hand boy so that
                  he leans back and kicks up his foot in the same manner as
                  Reynolds’s. Gainsborough’s female figure has, however, a
                  greater sensuality, revealing the hint of a nipple, and she
                  and her three children are more ragged. Their bare, dirty feet
                  concede the actualities of the life of the poor and
                  demonstrate their need, while the beauty of the mother and the
                  grace of the children’s deportment suggest they have been
                  aestheticized for consumption within a genteel domestic
                  interior. Despite these crucial differences, the basic
                  vocabulary of Gainsborough’s and Reynolds’s figural groups is
                  remarkably similar, and suggests a direct relationship between
                  the two works.

                  Gainsborough would have had ample opportunity to see
                  Reynolds’s <em>Charity</em> when he presented it at the 1779
                  Academy exhibition, to which Gainsborough himself had
                  contributed six works.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn74" id="fnref74">74</a></sup>&nbsp;<em>Charity Relieving Distress</em> seems, in fact, to refer
                  directly to Reynolds’s figure, incorporating his allegorical
                  image into an everyday scenario of spontaneous benevolence.
                  Indeed, it is worth pointing out that the source of the boy’s
                  unusual pose in both paintings appears to be Raphael’s
                  Cartoon, <em>The Healing of the Lame Man</em> (ca. 1515–16;
                  <a href="#gcole-fig12">fig. 12</a>), in which a nude boy in
                  the foreground leans back and lifts his foot while tugging at
                  the sash of one of the spectators.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn75" id="fnref75">75</a></sup>&nbsp;Raphael’s Cartoons were the epitome of high art in England;
                  although ensconced at Hampton Court, they were highly visible
                  to artists through James Thornhill’s painted copies and
                  Nicolas Dorigny’s engravings, and were made the subject of
                  various treatises espousing their virtues as models for
                  aspiring artists.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn76" id="fnref76">76</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Seeing Gainsborough’s beggar woman as a personification of
                  Charity, and as a deliberate quotation of the high-art
                  tradition exemplified by Raphael and utilized in Reynolds’s
                  painting, has important implications for the painting’s
                  meaning and its relationship to eighteenth-century art theory.
                  Indeed, it appears that Gainsborough presents two figures of
                  charity here. The ragged woman lightly carrying her load of
                  children epitomizes the allegorical, Christian, and maternal
                  Charity of the high-art tradition, while the young woman in
                  the door represents the particularized, individual almsgiving
                  frequently depicted in British fancy pictures. From this point
                  of view, it seems that the allegorical figure of Charity has
                  brought the two additional children to the door, where they
                  gratefully receive the alms that the young woman bestows. Two
                  dimensions of charity are thus depicted: its generalized,
                  allegorical conceptualization, and its everyday practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Reinforcing these differentiated, but complementary, forms of
                  charity, the architectural elements of Gainsborough’s painting
                  correspond to their ideal and practical forms. Behind the
                  personification of Charity, the church spire emphasizes her
                  status as a visualization of one of the three Christian
                  virtues; and, on the other side of the composition, the open
                  door of the townhouse suggests the generous distribution of
                  material wealth that ordinary benevolence entails. The paired
                  figures of charity, and the paired apertures that allow access
                  to the different edifices of benevolence, combine to form a
                  composite image of charity that combines its ideal and
                  everyday expressions. In this sense, Gainsborough’s painting
                  stages a moment of contact between the “general” and
                  “particular” forms of representation that differentiate
                  history painting from the lower genres in eighteenth-century
                  British art discourse. From this perspective,
                  <em>Charity</em> <em>Relieving Distress</em> offers an
                  alternative approach to the hierarchy of pictorial modes that
                  attempts to reconcile the putatively higher and lower forms of
                  art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn77" id="fnref77">77</a></sup>

                  The discourse of general and particular forms was used by
                  Reynolds to differentiate the best exemplars of painting, and
                  the opposed visual vocabularies appropriate to history
                  painting and the minor genres.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn78" id="fnref78">78</a></sup>&nbsp;In his <em>Discourses</em> Reynolds established his, and the
                  institution’s prerogative: to provide a system of art
                  education that would elevate art and the status of artists to
                  the highest possible level. In order to achieve this aim,
                  sufficiently talented students were encouraged to dedicate
                  themselves to the pursuit of general form and to the genre of
                  history painting, traditionally viewed as the highest mode of
                  art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn79" id="fnref79">79</a></sup>&nbsp;While all art in Reynolds’s theory is based upon imitation,
                  the “great stile” of history painting is distinguished for its
                  selective synthesis of particular observations to produce an
                  ideal and unseen beauty. As the president put it, “the whole
                  beauty and grandeur of the art consists . . . in being able to
                  get above all singular forms, local customs, particularities
                  and details of every kind.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn80" id="fnref80">80</a></sup>&nbsp;Through the combination of the best and most universal forms
                  in nature and the study of the old masters (Reynolds
                  recommends Raphael, Michelangelo, and the Carracci), the
                  artist was to aim at producing an “idea of the perfect state
                  of nature”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn81" id="fnref81">81</a></sup>&nbsp;For Reynolds, general form presented a “true idea of beauty”
                  and conferred an ennobling “intellectual dignity” upon the
                  productions of art that would ensure their posterity and
                  cultivation of public virtue.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn82" id="fnref82">82</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Particular form, on the other hand, constituted a close
                  observation of the varieties of things visible in nature.
                  While general form depicted an ideal image of human action and
                  beauty, carefully selected and composed, the particular was
                  produced through the imitation of specific models. For
                  Reynolds, it was epitomized by Dutch paintings by Adriaen van
                  Ostade and Adriaen Brouwer, scenes that showed “people engaged
                  in their own peculiar occupations; working, or drinking,
                  playing or fighting”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn83" id="fnref83">83</a></sup>&nbsp;Dutch painting formed a paradigm of the particular for
                  Reynolds, who concluded that the Dutch were “so far from
                  giving a general view of human life, that they exhibit all the
                  minute particularities of a nation differing in several
                  respects from the rest of mankind”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn84" id="fnref84">84</a></sup>&nbsp;While Reynolds admits that the Dutch artists were “excellent
                  in their own way”,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn85" id="fnref85">85</a></sup>&nbsp;he encouraged his students to keep their “principal
                  attention fixed upon the higher excellencies” and to practise
                  producing the general form required for history painting.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn86" id="fnref86">86</a></sup>&nbsp;In advancing the general over the particular, Reynolds aimed
                  at promoting a universally elevating and ennobling form of art
                  liberated from the dictates of fashion or other cultural
                  specificities, and able to appeal to the apparently
                  unchanging, abstract and universal principles of human
                  nature.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn87" id="fnref87">87</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Reynolds aligned general and particular form with a hierarchy
                  of genres that elevated the “great style” of history painting
                  and demoted the genres of portraiture, landscape, and the
                  fancy picture. The generality of the subject matter conferred
                  superiority upon the genre, hence, “a History-Painter paints
                  man in general; a Portrait-Painter, a particular man, and
                  consequently, a defective model.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn88" id="fnref88">88</a></sup>&nbsp;As a result, Reynolds advised students to take up
                  “sufficiently general” subjects, such as “the great events of
                  Greek and Roman fable and history”, which are “familiar and
                  interesting to all Europe”, and “the capital subjects of
                  scripture history, which, besides, their general notoriety,
                  become venerable by their connection with our religion”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn89" id="fnref89">89</a></sup>&nbsp;Alternatively, the lower genres could be improved by
                  borrowing from the methods of history painting, and to this
                  end, Reynolds commended the use of allegorical figures in
                  genres such as portraiture as appropriately general inclusions
                  that will elevate the picture through allusion to grand and
                  heroic ideas and concepts. Unlike allegorical poetry, which he
                  found rather tedious, Reynolds insisted that allegorical
                  figures in painting could produce “a greater variety of ideal
                  beauty, a richer, more various and delightful composition”,
                  and create an opportunity to exhibit the artist’s skill.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn90" id="fnref90">90</a></sup>&nbsp;As Reynolds’s <em>Charity</em> and
                  <em>Lady Cockburn and Her Three Eldest Sons</em> attest, this
                  was a method the president put to especial use.

                <p>
                  Gainsborough’s invitation to join the Academy in 1768 put him
                  in contact with the theoretical tradition of art espoused by
                  Reynolds, and the ideological contrast it formed with his own
                  practice generated considerable friction. Though
                  characteristically evasive about the aims and meanings of his
                  paintings, Reynolds’s prejudice in favour of the great style
                  provoked occasional private outbursts from Gainsborough that
                  reveal his ideas about the nature and role of art. In a 1773
                  letter to the painter William Hoare, who had sent him a copy
                  of Reynolds’s fifth Discourse of 1772, in which the subject of
                  general and particular forms continued, Gainsborough confided:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Betwixt Friends Sir Joshua either forgets, or does not chuse
                    to see that his Instruction is all adapted to form the
                    History Painter, which he must know there is no call for in
                    this country . . . Every one knows that the grand Style must
                    consist in plainness &amp; simplicity . . . but Fresco would
                    no more do for Portraits, than an Organ would please Ladies
                    in the hands of Fischer; there must be Variety of lively
                    touches and surprizing Effects to make the Heart dance.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn91" id="fnref91">91</a></sup>

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The evident incongruity of calls for generalized, elevated
                  history painting with the demands of patrons for domestically
                  scaled paintings of secular subject matter, and indeed with
                  Gainsborough’s own empirical practice, which depicted the
                  sensual and ornamental in landscape, likeness, and dress,
                  appears to have troubled the artist, and curtailed expressions
                  of his artistic ambitions. In a 1783 letter to architect
                  William Chambers, describing his latest painting,
                  <em>Two Shepherd Boys with Dogs Fighting</em> (ca. 1783;
                  Iveagh Bequest, Kenwood) he attempted to distance himself from
                  Reynolds’s lofty aims. Declaring himself without ambitions
                  towards history painting, he wrote: “you know my cunning way
                  of avoiding great subjects in painting &amp; of concealing my
                  ignorance by a flash in the pan.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn92" id="fnref92">92</a></sup>&nbsp;These flippant remarks disguised, however, a deeper
                  engagement with academic precepts, and submerged a current of
                  thought that surfaced in his paintings.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn93" id="fnref93">93</a></sup>

                  Despite his protestations against history painting,
                  Gainsborough’s works of the 1780s betray a shift in attitude
                  towards its style and subjects, and carefully incorporated a
                  response to Reynolds’s dictates.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn94" id="fnref94">94</a></sup>&nbsp;Concluding his letter to Hoare, he claimed that “there is no
                  other Friendly or Sensible way of settling these matters
                  except on Canvass”, and in his productions of the 1780s, it
                  appears he did just that, by introducing deliberate,
                  inconspicuous historical references into his paintings.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn95" id="fnref95">95</a></sup>&nbsp;Indeed, the evidence of Gainsborough’s only attempt at
                  mythological painting, <em>Diana and Actaeon</em> (ca. 1784–6;
                  <a href="#gcole-fig13">fig. 13</a>), started some time in 1784
                  (the same year as <em>Charity Relieving Distress</em>),
                  confirms his interest in the possibilities of history
                  painting, blending and blurring mythological subjects with his
                  own idiosyncratic painterly style.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn96" id="fnref96">96</a></sup>&nbsp;Furthermore, in a 1783 letter to William Pearce,
                  Gainsborough claimed that his landscapes at the coming Royal
                  Academy exhibition were to be mounted “in the great stile”,
                  undoubtedly an indication of his new artistic ambitions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn97" id="fnref97">97</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  After numerous disputes with the hanging committee of the
                  Academy exhibitions, Gainsborough seceded from the institution
                  in April 1784 and, in this climate of artistic independence,
                  appears to have taken up the axioms of the Academy in complex
                  and provocative ways.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn98" id="fnref98">98</a></sup>&nbsp;<em>Charity Relieving Distress</em> was not included in the
                  list of paintings due to have been exhibited that year at the
                  Royal Academy, and given Gainsborough’s rapidity of execution,
                  it is conceivable that the painting was completed between his
                  secession in April and its private showing on 26 July.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn99" id="fnref99">99</a></sup>&nbsp;With its evident paraphrasing of Reynolds,
                  <em>Charity Relieving Distress</em> can indeed be read as a
                  response to the president’s ideals, but rather than rancorous
                  invective against the institution, it seems to propose an
                  alternative relationship between the artistic modes classified
                  by Reynolds that levels the hierarchy and reconciles the
                  divergent impulses of theory and practice, history painting
                  and fancy picture.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn100" id="fnref100">100</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  With Reynolds’s <em>Discourses</em> in mind, it appears that
                  <em>Charity Relieving Distress</em> takes up the academic
                  doctrine of general and particular forms. In this sense, the
                  painting gives us two versions of charity—one presented in a
                  generalized, allegorical style, and the other, a particular
                  instance of everyday benevolence appropriate to the fancy
                  pictures that Gainsborough was creating at this time.
                  Moreover, Gainsborough uses the contact established between
                  the two figures through the act of almsgiving to provide a
                  conciliatory connection between the pictorial traditions they
                  represent. He brings these two figures together via the
                  children they succour. Converging to assist the distressed,
                  the two charities fulfil the spiritual and practical demands
                  of compassion, and in so doing, combine the general and
                  particular forms of representation that Reynolds had argued to
                  be representative of the “great” and “inferior” styles of
                  painting.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn101" id="fnref101">101</a></sup>&nbsp;Their contact thus reconciles the allegorical and the
                  everyday, the visual vocabularies of history painting and the
                  fancy picture. From this perspective, Henry Bate-Dudley was
                  right to call this painting a “beautiful assemblage of an
                  interesting nature”, for Gainsborough’s work is indeed a
                  composite image that conjoins and connects both general and
                  particular form.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn102" id="fnref102">102</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The two figures of charity, expressive of the ideal and
                  practical forms of benevolence, thus enact an encounter
                  between the theoretical ideals of the Academy and
                  Gainsborough’s work in the fancy picture genre. Reynolds
                  himself had advocated the practice of borrowing or quoting
                  from classical art, either a “thought, an action, attitude or
                  figure”, and “transplanting it” into one’s work. This
                  borrowing, however, was to be motivated by rivalry: “he should
                  enter into a competition with his model”, claimed Reynolds,
                  “and endeavour to improve what he is appropriating into his
                  own work”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn103" id="fnref103">103</a></sup>&nbsp;For Gainsborough, this reference to Reynolds’s allegorical
                  figure of Charity appears made not to compete with or outstrip
                  him, but to propose a benevolent resolution between his
                  theoretical, generalizing model of art, and Gainsborough’s own
                  dedication to the observable world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn104" id="fnref104">104</a></sup>&nbsp;In their amicable cooperation, the two charities suggest a
                  peaceful meeting between the opposed artistic formulae, a
                  desired reconciliation between allegory and anecdote.
                  Moreover, the compositional equality with which they are
                  treated suggests a radical equivalence between the “great”
                  style of history painting and the everyday aesthetic of the
                  fancy picture.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn105" id="fnref105">105</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>Charity Relieving Distress</em> thus appropriates the
                  visual vocabulary of history painting into the compositional
                  “particularity” of the fancy picture; but rather than
                  incorporating history’s techniques through
                  <em>paragone</em>-style competition,
                  <em>Charity Relieving Distress</em> appears to argue for their
                  fundamental equality as different approaches to similar moral
                  questions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn106" id="fnref106">106</a></sup>&nbsp;Furthermore, this transposition takes place in
                  Gainsborough’s characteristically shimmering brushwork.
                  Transparent, layered glazes of paint add a luminous,
                  scintillating quality to the formal clarity of the figural
                  group. The looseness and mobility of successive strokes
                  invites the spectator’s optical completion, opening up the
                  painting to the imaginative participation of the viewer. This
                  appeal to the viewer’s sensibility was considered
                  inappropriate by Reynolds, who expressed misgivings about “the
                  great latitude which indistinctness gives to the imagination,
                  to assume almost what character or form it pleases”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn107" id="fnref107">107</a></sup>&nbsp;Gainsborough’s sensual and virtuosic style elicits an
                  interactive kind of beholding that insists not on the
                  authority of the artist’s own vision, but on a visual and
                  sentimental collaboration between work of art and viewer.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn108" id="fnref108">108</a></sup>&nbsp;As a result, the painting represents a desired rapprochement
                  between general and particular form with a “Variety of lively
                  touches and surprizing Effects” that truly “make the Heart
                  dance”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Gainsborough’s painting thus constructs three narratives of
                  compassionate exchange: charity is at once represented as a
                  moment of social contact between needy and benevolent, a
                  spiritual connection between earthly virtue and heavenly
                  reward, and lastly, as an ideal, conciliatory meeting between
                  the emblematic and the everyday that ultimately enacts a
                  resolution between high and low forms of art. While it is
                  perhaps tempting to see this painting as gesturing towards the
                  broader and more personal reconciliation that took place
                  between Reynolds and Gainsborough over the latter’s deathbed
                  in 1788, it is better understood as a commentary, not simply
                  on their personal rivalry, but on the nature and future of art
                  in Britain.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn109" id="fnref109">109</a></sup>&nbsp;In this sense it continues Hogarth’s legacy of the
                  “intermediate species of subject” and ongoing negotiation and
                  attenuation of the discourse of civic humanism. Mixing the
                  allegorical and the anecdotal, the theories of the academy
                  with the discourse on moral virtue, Gainsborough’s painting
                  offered a new paradigm for painting that reconciled the
                  divergent impulses of history painting and the fancy picture
                  and levelled the hierarchy of general and particular
                  forms.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn110" id="fnref110">110</a></sup>&nbsp;Like his contemporary, Joseph Wright of Derby, whose
                  paintings of scientific spectacles made similar use of the
                  scale and pathos of history painting, Gainsborough’s late work
                  provides a model for a morally serious art conceived for
                  domestic display and viewing by a middle-class audience.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn111" id="fnref111">111</a></sup>&nbsp;<em>Charity Relieving Distress</em> therefore constitutes a
                  pictorial argument for a modern kind of art that combines the
                  emblematic with the everyday, and which is embedded in the
                  values and experience of a commercial and sentimental age.

                        In late 1787, Gainsborough began to rebuild his
                        relationship with the Academy. Had he not died suddenly
                        in August 1788, there is evidence to suggest he would
                        have achieved a full reconciliation with the institution
                        and its members. See Whitley,
                        <em>Thomas Gainsborough</em>, 294–95, 306–7, and William
                        Vaughan, <em>Gainsborough</em> (London: Thames and
                        Hudson, 2002), 146. When Reynolds delivered his
                        fourteenth discourse in the form of a eulogy to
                        Gainsborough, it was clear that he was considered one of
                        the most significant members of the Academy.

                        Ellis Waterhouse notes that the painting was cut down to
                        30 x 39 in. (76.2 x 99 cm) from its original size of 49
                        x 39 in. (124.5 x 99 cm). See Waterhouse,

                        The print was made in 1801, either after Gainsborough’s
                        painting, or Dupont’s copy. There is little available
                        documentation on the provenance of
                        <em>Charity Relieving Distress</em>. Waterhouse notes
                        that it appeared in the Lord Robert Spencer sale of 1799
                        as an “Italian Villa”. See Waterhouse,

                        Postle has intriguingly described this figure as a
                        Catholic monk, in an interpretation of the potential
                        non-conformist religious meanings of this painting. See

                        232. Although this hooded figure bears some resemblance
                        to a Catholic monk, it differs widely from popular
                        satirical images of Catholics produced at the time. See
                        John Miller,

                        this painting provides little evidence for her
                        identification as a member of the working class,

                        The idea of an “argument in paint” is drawn from Edgar
                        Wind’s important essay “Hume and the Heroic Portrait”,
                        where it is applied to an analysis of the relationships
                        between philosophy and portraiture. Here I use it in
                        relation to art theory and Gainsborough’s visualization
                        of an alternative formula for morally serious painting
                        to that outlined by Reynolds. See Edgar Wind,

                        Donna Andrew, in her study of charities in
                        eighteenth-century London, argues that the most
                        successful institutions were those that combined
                        compassion, patriotism, and mercantile interest in their
                        rhetoric. See Andrew,

                        growing humanitarianism of eighteenth-century
                        philanthropic culture, see David Owen,

                        Owen has described eighteenth-century British charity as
                        modern humanitarianism—a collective effort that replaced
                        erratic and feudal forms of aristocratic beneficence.
                        See Owen, <em>English Philanthropy</em>, 12–13. Paul
                        Langford describes the new kind of entrepreneurial,
                        middle-class charitable individual in Langford,
                        <em>A Polite and Commercial People: England 1727–1783</em>
                        (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989), 482–84.
                        Eighteenth-century clerics and commentators also argued
                        that charity constituted an opportunity for moral
                        reform—of both giver and receiver alike. See Andrew,
                        <em>Philanthropy and Police</em>, 42–43. According to
                        Barrell, the middle classes had the most to gain from
                        the promotion of social virtues such as charity to the
                        level of public responsibility, as the confusion between
                        public and private virtues minimized the difference
                        between the enfranchised ruling classes and the
                        unenfranchised, “private” members of society, and thus
                        permitted the latter to participate in the cultural
                        shaping of English society. See John Barrell,
                        <em>Political Theory of Painting</em>, 54–58.

                        philosophy, literature, and poetry placed an increasing
                        emphasis on the role of sympathetic feeling in creating
                        social formations, in day to day social intercourse as
                        well as the reception of books and works of art. Paul

                        Charity is performed here by women, who seem to be the
                        sources of benevolence. This may be linked to what
                        Asfour and Williamson have pointed out are dominant
                        themes of nurture and nourishment in the Cottage Doors,
                        which are likewise administered by women rather than
                        men. See Amal Asfour and Paul Williamson,
                        “Gainsborough’s Cottage-door Scenes: Aesthetic
                        Principles, Moral Values”, in

                        Rosenthal identifies the pigeon as an evocation of the
                        Holy Spirit in <em>Art of Thomas Gainsborough</em>, 231,
                        as does Postle, <em>Thomas Gainsborough</em>, 67.
                        Gainsborough was not averse to allegorical spiritual
                        allusions. Rosenthal examines other traces of religious
                        iconography in “Gainsborough’s Cottage Doors”, 81–83.
                        Asfour and Williamson have also analysed the broad,
                        heterogeneous spirituality of Gainsborough’s work,
                        particularly its connection to themes of the New
                        Testament and the life of Christ. See Asfour and
                        Williamson, <em>Gainsborough’s Vision</em>, 261–67.

                        showed an interest in religious iconography, which is

                        but it now seems clear that his paintings reveal a
                        greater intellectual ambition than his letters and

                        The complex relationship between Reynolds and
                        Gainsborough was well documented by their
                        contemporaries. See William Jackson, who catalogues
                        their differences in
                        <em>The Four Ages; Together with Essays on Various
                          Subjects</em>
                        (London: Cadell and Davies, 1798), 170–84.

                        Rosenthal suggests that relations between Reynolds and
                        Gainsborough began to change during this period. In
                        1782, Reynolds bought Gainsborough’s
                        <em>Girl and Pigs</em>, and in the same year,
                        Gainsborough began to paint the president’s portrait, a
                        work that remained unfinished. See Rosenthal,
                        “Gainsborough’s <em>Diana and Actaeon</em>”, 182.

                        113. Rosenthal has argued that Gainsborough “painted
                        against Reynolds’s academicism” in landscapes that
                        develop “serious” ethical and artistic meanings. See
                        Rosenthal, “Landscape as High Art”, in
                        <em>Glorious Nature: British Landscape Painting,
                          1750–1850</em>, ed. Katharine Baetjer (New York: Hudson Hills Press,
                        1993), 22–26. It is worth noting that Gainsborough’s
                        only trip abroad, to the Low Countries in September
                        1783, was taken not long before
                        <em>Charity Relieving Distress</em> was painted. His
                        exposure to the canon of European painting, particularly
                        the Flemish grand manner style of Rubens and Van Dyck,
                        may have inspired the inclusion of allegorical figures
                        in this picture. On Gainsborough’s trip, see Amal
                        Asfour, Paul Williamson, and Gertrude Jackson, “A Second
                        Sentimental Journey: Gainsborough Abroad”,
                        <em>Apollo</em> 146 (Aug. 1997): 27–30.

                        Rosenthal sees <em>Diana and Actaeon</em> as an example
                        of Gainsborough’s complex engagement with Reynolds’s
                        theory and practice that playfully combines an
                        appropriate subject with an inappropriate method of
                        execution. See Rosenthal, “Gainsborough’s
                        <em>Diana and Actaeon</em>”, 184–92. In my view,
                        <em>Charity Relieving Distress</em> is a similarly
                        critical work, which engages with concepts of genre and
                        representation. At Schomberg House in Pall Mall, where
                        the Gainsboroughs moved in 1774, they were neighbours to
                        the auctioneer James Christie. Gainsborough’s friendship
                        with Christie would have contributed to his knowledge of
                        old-master paintings and perhaps the influence of this
                        tradition on his practice in London. See Vaughan,
                        <em>Gainsborough</em>, 112.

                        The dispute was mainly over the hanging of
                        <em>The Three Eldest Princesses</em> according to “the
                        line”, which dictated full lengths be hung more than

                        The Royal Academy archive has a list of eight paintings
                        destined for the exhibition of 1784, but Whitley
                        cautions it may be incomplete. The list includes
                        portraits of royalty and aristocracy, as well as
                        <em>The Three Eldest Princesses</em>, which was at the
                        heart of the dispute. A letter to the editor of
                        <em>The St James’s Chronicle</em>, however, claims that
                        “thirteen or fourteen pictures from Mr Gainsborough’s
                        pencil were withdrawn”, and in Bate-Dudley’s article in
                        <em>The Morning Herald</em> of 1784, the number is
                        increased to seventeen. See Whitley,
                        <em>Thomas Gainsborough</em>, 212–13. It is therefore
                        unclear whether <em>Charity Relieving Distress</em> was
                        painted for the exhibition, or after Gainsborough’s
                        secession.

                        an alternative to Reynolds’s formula for academic
                        painting. See Rosenthal, “Gainsborough’s Cottage Doors”,

                        Solkin argues that an inverse movement in history
                        painting toward the particularizing details of genre
                        painting characterizes the works exhibited at Vauxhall
                        and the Foundling Hospital by Hogarth and Hayman.
                        Gainsborough’s combination of genre echoes this tendency
                        in the fancy picture. See Solkin,

                        This could also be read as a resolution between the
                        public virtues of humanist history painting (evoked by
                        the emblematic figure of Christian charity), and the
                        private virtues depicted in genre painting (symbolized
                        by the generous young lady). In this sense,
                        Gainsborough’s painting responds to what Barrell has
                        identified as a “complication of the distinction between
                        public and private virtue” that ultimately attenuated
                        the authority of humanism in British culture. See

                        Bermingham argues persuasively that Gainsborough’s paint
                        handling produces an “optical fusion” between painting
                        and beholder. See her Introduction to
                        <em>Sensation and Sensibility</em>, 15–16. Barrell has
                        remarked that Reynolds “repeatedly attributes value to
                        what is fixed, settled, permanent, solid, as opposed to
                        whatever is floating, fluctuating, fleeting, variable”.

                        and Williamson have suggested that Gainsborough’s
                        paintings are in fact about perception, and “less
                        concerned with apprehending nature <em>per se</em> than
                        with an awareness of the process of apprehension”. See

                        Michael Cole argues that Gainsborough developed an
                        “alternative, anti-Historical ideal for the fledgling

                        and resolve their principles with his own.

                  At the end of the Second World War, the Hungarian-Jewish
                  painter Magda Cordell McHale fled to London, where she
                  remained until 1961, when she moved to the United States to
                  pursue a career in futurology with her husband, the artist
                  John McHale (d. 1978). The decade or so she spent in London
                  was the most prolific phase in her artistic career. It saw her
                  involved in the foundation of the Independent Group (1952–55),
                  and exhibiting at the Institute of Contemporary Arts and the
                  Hanover Gallery. Although Cordell was widely recognized for
                  her ambivalent portrayals of the female body as mythic
                  archetype and techno-scientific testing ground, she has not
                  received due acknowledgment in the recent literature on
                  postwar Britain and the Independent Group. This article
                  re-evaluates the legacy of her proto-feminist artworks,
                  arguing for Cordell’s important contribution to postwar
                  British art and culture.

                  Magda Cordell’s paintings from the 1950s are monumental and
                  monumentally lurid. Reviewers have compared them to monsters
                  and fertility idols, likening their texture to blood, amniotic
                  liquid, and, on one occasion, “neon-lit pleura”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;Born in 1921 into a Hungarian-Jewish family before the
                  outbreak of the Second World War, Cordell fled Hungary to
                  escape Nazism and eventually migrated to Great Britain with
                  her husband, the English composer Frank Cordell.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Together they participated in the creation of the
                  Independent Group (IG), an unofficial movement of artists,
                  architects, designers, musicians, and critics who met at the
                  Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London from 1952 to
                  1955 with the shared ambition of introducing mass culture into
                  what they saw as the conservative establishment of the fine
                  arts galleries.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>&nbsp;Cordell was the only female and non-British artist in the
                  IG, with connections to the world of Continental painting and
                  the community of émigrés artists of middle European and Jewish
                  origin who gravitated in the orbit of the Hanover Gallery.
                  What little posterity has made of her artistic legacy is tied
                  to her founding role in the group, even though her canvases
                  sit uncomfortably with the proto-Pop aesthetic of
                  advertisements and Americana commonly associated with that
                  moment. This article reconsiders a series of paintings and
                  exhibitions that Cordell produced during her last London years
                  (a period of about half a decade following the end of the IG
                  meetings in 1955), with the objective of drawing attention to
                  her consistent attempts to denaturalize on the plane of the
                  canvas the stereotypical identification of femininity with the
                  nurturing maternal body.

                  The art historian David Mellor is right to claim that what is
                  “exceptional” about Cordell’s paintings “lies in their aspect
                  of female signs; that is, they act as signs for an internal
                  and—crucially—maternal body, unrepresented elsewhere in
                  British art at this moment”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>&nbsp;In spite of this, or perhaps for this very reason,
                  first-hand testimonies of her postwar activities are few and
                  far between. The most comprehensive source of information is a
                  lamentably short feature on her work published in the first
                  issue of the journal <em>Uppercase</em> (1958;
                  <a href="#gsmith-fig1">fig. 1</a>), a remarkable experiment in
                  the graphic arts initiated and edited by the British architect
                  Theo Crosby.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>&nbsp;Among its illustrations the reader will find a compelling
                  portrait of Cordell standing in front of
                  <em>Figure (Woman)</em> from 1956–7 (<a href="#gsmith-fig2">fig. 2</a>), a signature example of her treatment of the female body as
                  a ballooned aggregate of pictorial lumps. Presumably included
                  to give a sense of the epic scale of her canvases, the
                  photograph frames a three-quarter-length Cordell glamorously
                  posing against the figure’s swollen navel (<a href="#gsmith-fig3">fig. 3</a>). Not only is this portrait a rare document of the artist’s
                  legendary panache, but it is also a highly symbolic
                  illustration of what is at stake in rediscovering her
                  practice, for it dramatizes the naturalized correspondence of
                  womb and woman in its midst.

                  Little secondary literature is available on Cordell, and none
                  of it revisits Crosby’s feature in <em>Uppercase</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>&nbsp;Being sidelined is not an uncommon fate for a woman active
                  in a male-dominated art world, especially in the postwar
                  period, but such a manoeuvre downplays the original
                  circumstances of this artist’s career, for Cordell was a
                  successful painter, with shows in prominent London venues such
                  as the Hanover Gallery and the ICA.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>&nbsp;This article is an attempt to make up for the neglect that
                  her art has suffered. The works that will be considered were
                  all made before 1961, when Cordell moved to the United States
                  with her second husband, fellow IG artist John McHale, to
                  pursue an academic career in futurology, an interdisciplinary
                  research field concerned with postulating future global trends
                  on the basis of patterns of continuity and change.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>&nbsp;Importantly, Cordell never stopped considering herself a
                  painter. Looking back to the experience of the IG many years
                  later, she wrote: “I am a European painter, for me that
                  figure, that shape, is still superior to all that”—“all that”
                  presumably meaning the spectacle of mass reproducible images
                  that in the 1950s other artists in the IG had started to
                  assimilate into their works of art through techniques of
                  montage.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>&nbsp;In spite of such statements, Cordell’s postwar paintings
                  suggest that she shared the group’s fascination with popular
                  varieties of anthropology, ethnography, science, and science
                  fiction. Like her peers, Cordell was interested in how these
                  disciplines offered an evolutionary perspective on the nature
                  of intergenerational change, and in particular on the
                  mechanism of collective adaptation to changing environmental
                  circumstances. This had become an intimate concern for a
                  generation of young men and women who had survived the Second
                  World War only to witness the transition to a mass consumer
                  society and the new global configuration that emerged with the
                  Cold War. The following pages posit that this is the arena in
                  which Cordell’s figures come alive. Her paintings from the
                  late 1950s pit nurture against nature by reconstructing the
                  effects of a changing techno-cultural environment on the
                  maternal–foetal organism, whilst also exposing this as a
                  powerful symbolic vessel for the fantasies of collective
                  regeneration of the postwar society.

                  In 1945 the Allied victory had tipped the balance of world
                  power in favour of the United States, paving the way for the
                  dissolution of the British Empire and the onset of inflation
                  and austerity in the motherland. Britain’s foreign policy was
                  increasingly assimilated within a broader Western bloc piloted
                  by the US in the ensuing Cold War against Soviet Communism,
                  while the emphasis on techno-industrial regeneration and
                  military capability dominated domestic politics across
                  parties.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>&nbsp;It was only in the late 1950s that efforts to intensify the
                  rate of technological innovation and accelerate consumption
                  came to fruition under the wings of the dollar. Cordell’s move
                  to figuration coincided with Britain’s recovery from the war.
                  It was in 1955, in fact, that she switched from abstraction
                  (large grid compositions, none of which survive today) to
                  figuration, a genre that was to dominate her work for the rest
                  of her life. She exhibited her new paintings in 1956, the year
                  in which the consumer-driven economic boom officially ended a
                  decade of rationing, giving way to a general—though by no
                  means truly inclusive—sense of rising affluence.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>&nbsp;The mass media played a key role in cementing the
                  psychological effects of this epochal regeneration; and even
                  before the verdict of economic growth was official, American
                  magazines and films in Technicolor projected the cathartic
                  fantasy of an unprecedented opulence. The IG was quick to
                  register the euphoric effects of this bonanza. “In some sense
                  we felt that the new images might help us to prevent the
                  repetition of the inhuman and unseemly past”, Cordell later
                  remembered. “It was with some excitement, then, that we
                  approached the new and tried to erase the old.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cordell started experimenting with a range of techniques and
                  binders (including oil, ink, wax, acrylic, and polymer resin)
                  to achieve different degrees of density and transparency on
                  canvas. She worked in series, testing out the variations on
                  two main iconographic typologies, often differentiated with
                  the alternative titles of “Figure” or “Presence”. The former
                  tend to be acephalic (headless) and gynomorphic (female
                  shaped), though Cordell also produced a number of male
                  variants with elongated necks, reminiscent of Francis Bacon’s
                  screaming creatures of the same period. The gender is
                  sometimes noted in the title, as in the case of
                  <em>Figure (Woman)</em> (<a href="#gsmith-fig3">fig. 3</a>),
                  against which she had her portrait taken in 1958. Lost in the
                  black-and-white reproduction is the bright blue background
                  against which the figure emerges as a blazing assemblage of
                  bright orange and red body parts, which, far from being
                  anatomically accurate, are concentrated around three areas
                  with overt feminine connotations: thighs, breasts, and navel.

                  More so than the Figures, whose labyrinthine tangles of paint
                  sometimes look flattened by the pressure of a rolling weight,
                  the Presences emerge out of the pictorial frame in relief.
                  They are smaller, abstract entities that tend to be organized
                  in concentric haloes, combining the mystical tradition of
                  religious icons with the recently discovered dimensions of
                  sub-atomic physics and cytological cross-sections on a Petri
                  dish. Whether their core is in fact a relief or a gaping hole
                  is left to the imagination of the viewer. Take painting
                  <em>No.12</em> (<a href="#gsmith-fig4">fig. 4)</a>, for
                  example. The background is deep crimson and encircles a
                  thicker, oblong halo, inside which floats an even more clotted
                  globular nucleus (in bright pink, yellow, and red), whose
                  texture betrays the use of liquid plastic (<a href="#gsmith-fig5">fig. 5</a>). Not only do Cordell’s Presences evoke the body on the
                  plane of the haptic imagination, but often they also resemble
                  internal organs in formation, oscillating in the eyes of the
                  beholder between embryo, placenta, kidney, liver, and pleura.
                  Their ambivalence as signs treads the line between abstraction
                  and figuration, complicating the idea that Cordell simply
                  dropped one for the other—rather, the figure here appears
                  “under abstraction”, to borrow from Andrew Lee.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>&nbsp;Perhaps it would be accurate to say that Figures and
                  Presences represent an ecosystem of interdependent organisms,
                  with the former depicting a grotesque maternal body and the
                  latter hinting at its embryonic content, though both can also
                  be seen to collapse the relation between inside and outside.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Theo Crosby’s introduction to Cordell’s work in the first
                  issue of <em>Uppercase</em> offers the most authoritative
                  account of her technique to date. After crediting her for
                  having “heralded the abstract expressionist movement in this
                  country”, the editor informs us that “the AE [Abstract
                  Expressionist] fallacy of the happy accident does not apply”
                  to this painter. According to him, she was more concerned with
                  “reconstructing the human image” through a painstaking,
                  quasi-sculptural process of accretion that involved collaging,
                  glazing, and overpainting, and which ultimately led her to
                  work directly with pigment and plastic on canvas, “producing
                  some quite remarkably beautiful effects”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>&nbsp;Only a few years earlier, Lawrence Alloway—possibly the most
                  imaginative art critic in the IG and a very close friend of
                  Cordell’s—had compared her working method to a speeded-up
                  movie of a tapestry being woven.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>&nbsp;On her part, Cordell called herself a “binge painter”, who
                  would go on layering pigment until she was “limp and all wrung
                  out”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>&nbsp;Everyone agreed that her works were monuments to process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Crosby was also quick to remark on the visceral physicality of
                  Cordell’s paintings, claiming that they offer the human body
                  “sliced any way you like”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>&nbsp;This choice of words situates <em>No.12</em> at the
                  interface of surgery and butchery, drawing out the impression
                  of violent bodily disintegration transmitted by its bloody
                  tonalities. In this respect, Cordell’s work is in keeping with
                  that of a generation of postwar painters who tried to reduce
                  the brutalities of the recent war to a common denominator that
                  would transcend history’s contingencies: truly abstract
                  horror, distilled at the limit of the amorphous. For artists
                  as different as Francis Bacon, Jean Dubuffet, and Alberto
                  Burri this meant dismembering and tearing at the human form on
                  the plane of the canvas. Bacon called it “a complete
                  interlocking of image and paint and <em>vice versa</em>”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>&nbsp;In 1955, the architectural critic Reyner Banham explicitly
                  linked Cordell’s work to the European context of
                  <em>Tachisme</em> and <em>Art informel</em> (as well as
                  American Abstract Expressionism). In a manifesto-like article
                  titled “The New Brutalism”, Banham announced the emergence of
                  a new avant-garde movement with international affiliations and
                  a local epicentre in the context of the IG.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>&nbsp;“As a descriptive label”, he wrote, Brutalism “has two
                  overlapping, but not identical senses”: the first is
                  architectural and is indebted to the postwar designs of the
                  British couple Alison and Peter Smithson; the second refers to
                  the <em>art brut</em> of Jean Dubuffet and includes Jackson
                  Pollock, Karel Appel, and Alberto Burri, among the foreign
                  artists, and Eduardo Paolozzi, Nigel Henderson and Cordell in
                  London.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>&nbsp;Together with the Smithsons, these last three artists were
                  to represent the Brutalist sub-faction of the IG. There is no
                  evidence that Cordell welcomed the epithet of Brutalist
                  artist, though she was familiar with, and perhaps inspired by,
                  the work of Dubuffet and Burri, which travelled to London for
                  major exhibitions at the ICA and the Hanover Gallery.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup>&nbsp;Indeed, her paintings appear just as distant from Dubuffet’s
                  funereal bricolages of mud and ashes, as they are from the
                  rustic iconography of scarification recognized by many in the
                  stitched up <em>Sacchi</em> that Burri made after serving as a
                  military surgeon in the Second World War (whereas his
                  experiments with red plastic came later in the 1960s).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">22</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a 1960 interview, Cordell used the metaphor of organic
                  self-repair to describe her works, and explained that “they
                  can cut away huge pieces of your internal organs and you will
                  grow them again or compensate for their loss. And also, all
                  the time that your body is renewing itself, so in your
                  lifetime you are remade countless times. This to me is an
                  incredible thing.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">23</a></sup>&nbsp;Clearly the question of biological endurance was close to
                  the bone for someone who had escaped the Holocaust. Yet, her
                  paintings resist being reduced to symptoms of wartime trauma.
                  More than open wounds and existential incisions, they evoke
                  supernatural embryos in formation, or organs waiting to be
                  transplanted whilst still beating to the artificial rhythm of
                  a technologically inflected vitalism. Crucially, the
                  solidified blotches of polymer resin on Cordell’s canvases
                  cast the allusion of biological plasticity in a highly
                  synthetic facture. Hence, when she said that “for me that
                  figure, that shape, is still superior to all that”, Cordell
                  did not dismiss the material world of the postwar society.
                  Quite the opposite, her paintings show fantastical
                  regenerative properties precisely because their surfaces are
                  visibly projected towards the high-tech sensorium of the
                  consumer miracle. Ultimately, the event of physical renewal
                  appears simultaneously a meta-commentary on painting’s
                  cathartic faculties and a signifier of the transformations of
                  the postwar epoch—Cordell’s complete interlocking of image and
                  paint.

                <p>
                  Cordell discovered the power of speculative thinking in
                  popular science fiction magazines imported from the United
                  States, such as <em>Galaxy Science Fiction</em>. That she
                  approved of sci-fi is evinced from the titles of the works on
                  display in 1956 in her solo show at the Hanover Gallery (all
                  1955): <em>Android m</em> and <em>Android f</em> hint at
                  trans-human robots; <em>Osmotic I</em> and <em>II</em>, as
                  well as <em>Algal</em>, speak of elemental life forms; while
                  <em>Nova</em> and <em>Supernova</em> take the evolutionary
                  poetics of origins to the realm of the galactic, imagining
                  atomic explosions in white dwarf stars.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">24</a></sup>&nbsp;If the androids are Figures of sorts, the outer space series
                  fits in with Cordell’s more abstract Presences, displaying the
                  same concentric structure. A black-and-white close-up of the
                  nucleus of <em>Nova</em> (<a href="#gsmith-fig6">fig. 6</a>)
                  reproduced in the exhibition catalogue tells us that the
                  painting was organized around an oblong spark of white paint
                  bursting out of a cloud of darker washes, as in a contained
                  galactic explosion (Wols may have been a direct reference
                  here). Taken together, the different works in the exhibition
                  can be imagined as tracing the evolution of the human into the
                  alien—be it by interstellar breeding or terrestrial gene
                  modification. Importantly, popular science’s fantasies of
                  genetic rewiring had just come one step closer to reality with
                  the discovery of the double helix, made in 1953 in Britain
                  with the aid of X-ray crystallography. In truth, however, the
                  audience of Cordell’s solo show did not make the link with
                  this particular discovery, comparing it instead to the
                  paintings of Jackson Pollock and Willem De Kooning on display
                  at the same time at the Tate, in
                  <em>Modern Art in the United States: A Selection from the
                    Collections of the Museum of Modern Art</em>
                  (1956). The first major display of Abstract Expressionism in
                  London, its reception rapidly permeated Cordell’s own exhibit,
                  even though she maintained not to have been aware of the work
                  of Pollock and De Kooning beforehand.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">25</a></sup>&nbsp;Alloway corrected this misapprehension in the catalogue of
                  the Hanover Gallery show, explaining that Cordell’s paintings
                  actually “reconstruct Action Painting’s missing content” with
                  a “compulsion of found iconographies”. The critic then goes on
                  to launch into an equally compulsive list of descriptive
                  adjectives from the realm of physics, chemistry, and
                  physiology:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    solar, delta, galactic, amorphous, ulterior, fused, far out,
                    viscous, skinned, visceral, variable, flux, nebular,
                    iridescence, hyper-space, free fall, random, circulation,
                    capacious, homeorphism, variegated, reticular, entanglement,
                    multiform, swimming pool, contraterrene.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">26</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  In another passage, Alloway put the same concept into prose:
                  what struck him at the Hanover Gallery was Cordell’s lyrical
                  superimposition of the body’s internal organs on outer space.
                  It would be hard not to relate this impression to the
                  levelling of micro and macro vision operated by camera.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cordell’s generation witnessed several revolutions in
                  technological imaging, chiefly as a result of the new demand
                  for scientific techniques of recording prompted by the two
                  world wars. In the early part of the twentieth century, the
                  photographic medium was successfully adapted for use in
                  defence. Most notably, in 1945 aerial reconnaissance
                  photographers were instrumental in planning D-day. In the
                  aftermath of the Second World War, British scientists and
                  captains of industry were united in calling for further
                  strategic investment in the medium’s military and peacetime
                  applications. Scientific photography was recognized as having
                  the potential to deliver a new order of reality, with almost
                  limitless possibilities for advancing the frontier of human
                  knowledge and rationalizing the natural world into
                  increasingly precise visual data. The business community was
                  adamant that mechanical techniques of visual recording could
                  be used to boost the country’s competitiveness in the most
                  disparate fields, from agriculture to biomedical research.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">27</a></sup>&nbsp;To promote this argument, illustrations of the camera’s
                  versatile uses—from X-rays to space photography, electron
                  photomicrography, aerial reconnaissance, and infrared
                  imaging—started to circulate widely across a range of
                  specialized and popular magazines, quickly gaining iconic
                  currency in the collective imaginary. The IG’s enthusiastic
                  discovery of recent avant-garde experiments with the visual
                  world of science—particularly László Moholy-Nagy’s
                  <em>Vision in Motion</em> (1947) and György Kepes’s
                  <em>Language of Vision</em> (1944)—was in keeping with this
                  context.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">28</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cordell’s paintings suggest that she owed as much to sci-fi
                  plots as to the—only marginally more sober—visual landscape
                  revealed by the scientific forays of the day.
                  <em>Figure 59</em> (1958; <a href="#gsmith-fig7">fig. 7</a>),
                  for example, demonstrates that the artist was interested in
                  registering the impact of the X-ray on the visual identity of
                  the human body. This decapitated, life-size figure does indeed
                  look sliced up or squashed into the dirty-white background to
                  the point of implosion. Its silhouette is reduced to an
                  irregular rectangle with only two pathetic lumps protruding at
                  the bottom (limbs once, perhaps), while its interiors appear
                  as a formless halo of soft body parts in dark pinks, yellows,
                  and browns. A red exoskeleton emerges in relief against this
                  mess of muddled viscera, with the anatomically incorrect
                  addition of a couple of breast-like rotundities on either side
                  of the spine. Presumably, this is the X-ray of a female.
                  Unsurprisingly, given how elaborate it is,
                  <em>Figure 59</em> was selected by Theo Crosby for publication
                  inside <em>Uppercase</em> 1, albeit in black and white. Here
                  it features next to another one of Cordell’s Figures, again
                  photographed in black and white, but this time toned in
                  orange—a choice of Pop design that was perhaps intended to
                  convey the Horror B-movie connotations of the originals (<a href="#gsmith-fig8">fig. 8</a>). If anything, however, the lack of colour and
                  three-dimensionality corroborates the impression that
                  <em>Figure 59</em> conjures a radiographic vision of the body.

                <p>
                  In his study of Cold War “visuality”, John Curley has
                  persuasively argued that photo-pictorial hybrids are
                  symptomatic of the epoch’s blossoming romance with the
                  illustrated press, citing an article that appeared on 16
                  November 1959 in <em>Life</em> magazine, under the title
                  “Analogies with Nature Help Explain Abstract Expressionist
                  Work”, which primed the audience for interpreting De Kooning’s
                  paintings with the aid of nature photographs that came
                  seductively close to abstraction.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">29</a></sup>&nbsp;Curley suggests that the comparisons invited by the article
                  were not all that misguided, in so far as what passed for
                  non-objective painting in the West was often tied to the
                  indexical mechanism of the camera.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">30</a></sup>&nbsp;Whether Cordell was painting directly from photographic
                  sources or not is open to speculation, however. What is clear
                  is that her solo show at the Hanover Gallery came into focus
                  through the lens of a hybrid photo-pictorial visuality seeped
                  in the Cold War’s cult of scientific discovery. The exhibits
                  were immediately recognized as superimposing the domains of
                  anatomy and astrophysics on the ground of the canvas,
                  appearing to Alloway as a sort of meta-atlas of the most
                  popular discoveries of the day. The numerical titles of so
                  many of Cordell’s paintings (<em>Figure 59</em>,
                  <em>No. 5</em>, <em>No. 12</em>, and so on) reinforce the
                  parallel with the world of repeatable scientific experiments,
                  suggesting that they are visual specimens of sorts, serial
                  prototypes testing the mutual contamination of mechanical and
                  biological reproduction.

                  The question of survival loomed large in the context of early
                  Cold War debates about the long-term clinical and
                  environmental effects of new subatomic technologies, from the
                  H-bomb to the more realistic threat of nuclear energy plants,
                  inaugurated in Britain in 1956.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">31</a></sup>&nbsp;Indeed, scholars such as Julian Myers have previously
                  considered the IG’s distinctive “future fetish” in relation to
                  the nuclear arms race and the space race.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">32</a></sup>&nbsp;What has gone unremarked is how Cordell explored these
                  anxieties in relation to the maternal–foetal body, the
                  ultimate “future fetish” and the symbolic ground par
                  excellence for imagining the survival of mankind as well as
                  its demise. Nowhere was this more explicit than in Edward
                  Steichen’s world-touring photo-exhibition
                  <em>The Family of Man</em>, which opened in 1955 at the Museum
                  of Modern Art in New York and one year later at the Southbank
                  Centre in London.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">33</a></sup>&nbsp;Curated in the name of global peacekeeping, but widely
                  criticized as a vehicle of US propaganda, the exhibition led
                  the audience through a tour of essentialist fantasies of
                  universal brotherhood centred to a significant extent on the
                  motif of pregnancy and family-making. The MoMA installation
                  ended with a large-scale colour transparency of the mushroom
                  cloud, a reassuringly abstract reminder that the future of all
                  life on earth hung by a thread. In such an ideologically
                  charged context, the swollen womb came to symbolize the
                  budding nucleus of a humanity to be globalized under the
                  paternalist wings of capitalist democracy. So Allan Sekula
                  argued in 1981, writing that the exhibition was a musty
                  “celebration of patriarchal authority that found its global
                  expression in the United Nations”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">34</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Cordell’s solo show at the Hanover Gallery coincided with the
                  Southbank iteration of the <em>Family of Man</em> as well as
                  with the Abstract Expressionism exhibit at the Tate. The
                  dystopian undertones of her exhibit are exacerbated when this
                  is read against MoMA’s attempt to deliver an idyllic snapshot
                  of American soft power in the complementary image of free
                  gestural expression and universal love. In her plea for a more
                  humane tomorrow, Cordell breathed life into a species of
                  monumental ogresses and androids whose X-rayed interiors
                  reveal mutating organs and a progeny worthy of the Cold War’s
                  worst apocalyptic fears. Their glowing nuclei metaphorically
                  evoke the phenomenon of radioactivity and by extension the
                  atom bomb, whose atrocious effects on the human body had only
                  become evident in the early 1950s, when visual documentation
                  of the aftermath of the American attacks on Hiroshima and
                  Nagasaki was leaked in the international press (and then
                  deliberately left out of the <em>Family of Man</em>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">35</a></sup>&nbsp;Pregnant women were seen to carry the most monstrous
                  consequences of the explosions, and even those who were not
                  expecting at the time were cursed with the stigma of having
                  “damaged” and “dangerous wombs”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">36</a></sup>&nbsp;While not explicitly referencing these stories, Cordell’s
                  paintings symbolically warn against the perils of another
                  armed confrontation on a global scale. If they display
                  regenerative faculties, then, they also cast a dystopian
                  shadow on the scientific achievements of a civilization which
                  had already gone too far down the road of technologized
                  imperialism.

                  One look at the brochure of <em>Class of '59</em> (The Union,
                  Cambridge, 1959), a group exhibition that Cordell shared with
                  McHale and Paolozzi, is enough to show that from the outset
                  her series were brought together under the sign of the
                  womb.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">37</a></sup>&nbsp;A single, poster-like foldable sheet, the document parades a
                  grotesque <em>cadavre exquis</em> with a sculpted head by
                  Paolozzi, the entrails of a collage by McHale, and the pelvic
                  extremity of one of Cordell’s figures (<a href="#gsmith-fig9">fig. 9</a>). On the back, Alloway’s commentary reinforces this
                  hierarchy, explaining that, while Paolozzi’s heads “peppered
                  with mechanisms” are all male and McHale’s collages represent
                  consumers, “Cordell’s transparent anatomies are like the
                  object of the cult of the female.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">38</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Alloway goes on to describe what we can safely guess to be one
                  of Cordell’s Presences with a series of metaphors borrowed
                  from Theodore Sturgeon’s science-fiction bestseller
                  <em>More Than Human</em> (1954): “Like a stone in a peach, a
                  yolk in an egg . . . . It was passive, it was receptive, it
                  was awake and alive.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">39</a></sup>&nbsp;This reading imbues the artwork with a sense of narrative
                  suspense, as if the canvas itself was in the process of
                  gestating and coming into being. The young photographer Robert
                  Freeman followed Alloway’s lead, praising the subject of
                  Cordell’s canvases—“the idol of fertility, the great
                  Mother-Whore and creator”—for reawakening a savage instinct in
                  “this age of corsets, cosmetics and celluloid sex”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">40</a></sup>&nbsp;Never mind the fact that the paintings in question are just
                  as synthetic as celluloid, Freeman’s interpretation consigns
                  them to the archetypal myth of the procreative body—and to
                  some extent it gets it right. For Cordell almost certainly
                  drew on prehistoric statuettes believed at the time to be
                  fertility idols and spuriously renamed “Venuses” (the most
                  widely admired of which was the Venus of Willendorf, dated to
                  approximately 25,000 BCE and discovered in 1908 in Willendorf,
                  Austria).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">41</a></sup>

                  Cordell seemingly reconfigured the archetype of the genetrix
                  into a monumental portrait of her own might and arguably a
                  grander vision of universal female empowerment. She would not
                  have been the first to do so. In 1944, the Venus of Willendorf
                  was reproduced in faded red and from three different angles on
                  the cover of Helen Rosenau’s book,
                  <em>Woman in Art: From Type to Personality</em> (<a href="#gsmith-fig10">fig. 10</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">42</a></sup>
                  Herself a Jewish refugee who came to England, Rosenau here
                  charts the development of artistic form from prehistory to
                  Barbara Hepworth’s abstract effigies (one of which is
                  superimposed onto the last Venus of Willendorf on the cover),
                  correlating this visual history with the evolution of the
                  female sex from “mere biological phenomenon” to an individual
                  “with a mind and a will of her own”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">43</a></sup>
                  It is tempting to play off Rosenau’s proto-feminist art
                  history against Freeman’s male gaze. After all, Cordell was
                  the first to pit self-expression against stereotype, the first
                  to set the stage for a gargantuan confrontation between the
                  haptic drama of her “binging” brushstrokes and the abstracting
                  logic of seriality and common denomination at the level of the
                  species. Indeed, the figures in her paintings are often only
                  distinguished by their gender, as with
                  <em>Figure (Woman)</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is certainly possible that Cordell encountered the Venus of
                  Willendorf in Rosenau’s book, but not quite as likely as her
                  finding it inside Amédée Ozenfant’s
                  <em>Foundations of Modern Art</em> (1928), where the
                  Willendorf statuette is reproduced next to a woman in a modern
                  swimming suit (<a href="#gsmith-fig11">fig. 11</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">44</a></sup>
                  Among the pages of Ozenfant’s book, Cordell would also have
                  found an image of the Venus of Lespugne (ca. 25,000 BCE;
                  discovered in 1922; <a href="#gsmith-fig12">fig. 12</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">45</a></sup>
                  The striking resemblance between the painter’s binary
                  iconographic typologies and these two artefacts leaves little
                  doubt as to their connection. On the one hand, the rotund
                  outline of the Venus of Willendorf, with its plump limbs and
                  overinflated breasts, is the archetype for Cordell’s
                  <em>Figure (Woman)</em>, with the notable difference that the
                  latter is headless. On the other hand, some of Cordell’s
                  Presences are unmistakably linked to the oblong assemblage of
                  dangling body parts that is the statuette uncovered at
                  Lespugne. Let us return to <em>No. 12</em> (<a href="#gsmith-fig4">fig. 4</a>). We can just about make out a head, a trunk, and a number
                  of breast-like body parts; the rest is an elongated and
                  vaguely gynomorphic aggregate of carnal tints characteristic
                  of Cordell’s palette. Similarly, the anatomy of the Lespugne
                  Venus is distorted by rotundities which have gone all limp and
                  out of place.

                  In the late 1940s, <em>Foundations of Modern Art</em> had
                  become something of a cult text for the artists and critics at
                  the ICA, who were mesmerized by its transhistorical
                  juxtapositions of black-and-white reproductions of artefacts
                  from disparate epochs and disciplines.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">46</a></sup>
                  While doing away with linear chronology, Ozenfant’s montage
                  nonetheless visualizes a fundamentally evolutionist teleology,
                  according to which the machines of the Industrial Revolution
                  and the art of the avant-garde correspond genealogically to
                  prehistoric tools and cave paintings. Man’s technological
                  instinct, the reader is shown, survives across millennia of
                  adaptations. In 1959, McHale penned a comparable argument for
                  the value of fertility idols in the age of consumer choice,
                  equating “the ikonic content of the mass media” with ancient
                  masks and totems that from the dawn of time had enabled
                  mankind to understand and deal with its environment—“external
                  and internal”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">47</a></sup>
                  As noted by Mark Wigley, McHale put forward a universal theory
                  of the visual as adaptive prosthesis, whereby “images are
                  literally consumed as a form of nutrition.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">48</a></sup>
                  This analysis provides a compelling rationale for the
                  sustained anthropomorphism of his montages of the second half
                  of the 1950s, following earlier experiments with geometric
                  abstraction in works such as <em>Construction Kit</em> (1954),
                  reprinted in <em>Uppercase</em> 1, 1958 (<a href="#gsmith-fig13">figs. 13</a>
                  and <a href="#gsmith-fig14">14</a>). As paintings such as
                  <em>Figure (Woman)</em> show, Cordell was similarly concerned
                  with the archetypal function of the human image as the
                  original&nbsp;“artificial organ”.

                <p>
                  More importantly, however, McHale’s ruminations chime with
                  widespread debates about the role of habitat versus biology
                  (or, in the philosophical terms of postwar existentialism,
                  existence versus essence) in shaping the development of the
                  individual and society. The war, the emergence of the welfare
                  state, and, later, the onset of the consumer society, put the
                  question of adaptation and “natural” development under the
                  spotlight, reigniting the age-old nature/nurture dispute
                  across a wide range of academic and popular platforms.
                  Unprecedented advances in embryology, epigenetics, and
                  genetics called for greater understanding of biological
                  plasticity and recognition of its limits, while a new
                  political commitment to welfare was responsible for an
                  efflorescence of sociological studies that stressed the role
                  of the environment. Anthropology offered a theoretical model
                  for mediating between biology and society, and McHale and his
                  peers were quick to apply it to the particular phenomenon of a
                  changing visual landscape. A case in point, Alloway drew on
                  evolutionary anthropology in his introduction to
                  <em>Class of '59</em>, suggesting that each of the artists on
                  display had presented a universal “generalisation” and a
                  “stereotype” of the generation in question (the class of
                  1959). Yet, the reader is told, there is nothing innate at the
                  core of the anthropomorphic figurations presented by Cordell,
                  McHale, and Paolozzi. Their only “survival characteristic”,
                  Alloway writes in markedly Darwinian spirit, is the
                  “legibility of the outline”. For the rest, they “exist in a
                  state of ambiguity, which means they have a potential for
                  change”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">49</a></sup>
                  This pseudo-epigenetic interpretation resonates with Cordell’s
                  Figures and Presences, whose dripping insides are barely kept
                  together by their silhouettes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It seems plausible to infer that Cordell had a manifest
                  interest in denaturalizing the rhetoric of biological destiny
                  at the heart of the postwar reconsolidation of the nuclear
                  family. Speaking from the perspective of psychoanalysis,
                  Juliet Mitchell remembers that “child-and-mother was the theme
                  song” of postwar Britain.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">50</a></sup>
                  Handbooks on family interaction became a phenomenon; while a
                  chorus of male experts placed “an almost mystical importance”
                  on the figure of mother as an agent of national
                  restoration.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">51</a></sup>
                  In the media and in the pages of women’s magazines the popular
                  psychoanalyst John Bowlby and his adepts promoted the idea
                  that maternal care was the only antidote to the feral imprint
                  left by the war on British children. Read against this
                  context, Cordell’s portrait in <em>Uppercase</em> takes on a
                  more polemical value than it would otherwise.
                  <em>Figure (Woman)</em> appears to merely parody the
                  ur-female—the woman as pure flesh, untainted by “make-up and
                  celluloid”. For her the nurturing attributes of Mother Nature
                  are ballooned to a point of saturation and toxic chemical
                  explosion. Equally, the abject misogynist fantasy of the alien
                  maternal interior is overstated by Cordell to a point of
                  caricature. This aligns her with later, so called
                  “essentialist” feminist artists, who found in the
                  representation of the abject female body a powerful channel
                  through which to play up their “feminitude”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">52</a></sup>
                  Crucially, unlike femininity, feminitude indicates the problem
                  of a female condition (rather than essential quality) rooted
                  in the body, real and imaginary.

                <p>
                  In 1961, in a short introductory note to the last exhibition
                  that Cordell had at the ICA before leaving London for good,
                  the visionary architect Buckminster Fuller felt it appropriate
                  to describe her as so “pre-occupied in her painting” as to be
                  “aloof to her gender”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53">53</a></sup>
                  Since then, her canvases have been saluted as “feminist
                  Ur-paintings” anticipating the future strategies of feminist
                  art rooted in the body. In 1998, Marc Mayer, the curator of a
                  small retrospective of Cordell’s work, opened the door for
                  revision: “Until I saw these works”, he admitted, “I had
                  believed, naively it turns out, that the aesthetic of blood
                  and guts, of entrails and viscera, was a major contribution to
                  art history that women had very recently made.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54">54</a></sup>&nbsp;If the works already spoke for female empowerment, Cordell’s
                  vocal condemnation of gender inequality came only years after
                  she and McHale had joined Buckminster Fuller, their friend and
                  inspiration, in the United States to become futurologists.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Futurology, or future studies, can be broadly explained as the
                  predictive analysis of the impact of technology on global
                  populations and the environment. In the 1960s, it flourished
                  across Europe and the United States through networks of think
                  tanks sponsored by private firms as much as academic
                  institutions. The nature of their research varied, but a key
                  distinction can be traced between what is sometimes called
                  “technocratic” or “elite futurology” and “liberal futurology”.
                  The former is distinguished by consultants working directly
                  for military or corporate agencies, while the latter is
                  comprised of university based groups cooperating with a wider
                  range of experts—anthropologists, sociologists, philosophers,
                  and even artists—to widen science’s public sphere and monitor
                  its ethical mandate (also known as “liberal futurology”).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55">55</a></sup>
                  The Center for Integrative Studies set up by Cordell and
                  McHale at various universities in the United States fell into
                  the second category, presenting itself as an alternative to
                  the expansionist logic of military and industrial
                  planning.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56">56</a></sup>
                  Only as part of this operation did Cordell denounce gender
                  inequality in print.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57">57</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The artist made a statement about her position on matters of
                  biological destiny in a report titled
                  <em>Women in World Terms</em>, authored with McHale and fellow
                  futurologist Guy Streatfeild. Armed with plenty of statistics
                  and trend charts, the report foresees the continued oppression
                  of women across both developed and undeveloped countries
                  unless change is implemented immediately. Crucially, the
                  authors maintain that it is only as a result of social
                  convention that the “mythical stereotype” of biological
                  destiny assumes the form of a natural law that justifies
                  patriarchy by positioning women in the subordinate role of
                  reproductive carers (as opposed to matriarchal leaders, for
                  example). “Though myths may not be history they do make
                  history”, explain the authors of
                  <em>Women in World Terms</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58">58</a></sup>
                  According to their analysis, one particularly nasty piece of
                  mythology is the archetype of the woman as duplicitous life
                  giver and man-eater: “it is not surprising that from the
                  social control of such mythic ambivalence, most societies have
                  developed elaborate sets of institutional rules to govern,
                  control and channel the assumed latent powers of women.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59">59</a></sup>
                  This passage in and of itself offers a commentary for the
                  subject of Cordell’s earlier paintings, suggesting that they
                  can legitimately be called ur*-*feminist and for two different
                  reasons. Firstly, because they can be seen to denaturalize the
                  idea of “natural” gender roles at its archetypal root, by
                  appropriating and re-imaging the modern reception of the Venus
                  of Willendorf; and secondly, because they anticipate the
                  attention to the body and the demand for reproductive freedom
                  of the feminist movements of the 1970s.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The American journalist Betty Friedan’s landmark publication,
                  <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> (1963), took the first steps
                  toward disclosing the oppression of the “happy housewife
                  heroine” of the early Cold War period, sparking a so-called
                  “second-wave” of feminist liberation movements in the United
                  States.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60">60</a></sup>
                  Friedan’s book documents the devastating psychological effects
                  of a decade of female “withdrawal into fertility”, citing the
                  words of the popular American anthropologist Margaret Mead,
                  who had only just spoken against a “return of the cave woman”
                  in the heyday of technological advancement.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61">61</a></sup>
                  Mead was connected to Cordell and McHale through futurology
                  and had likely been an influence on their critique of
                  biological determinism. Importantly, anthropology and the
                  study of myth underlie futurology’s evolutionary concept of
                  time and the notion that the transformations of the future are
                  always already incubated in the past. Mark Wigley used this
                  model to his own ends when he argued that the seeds for
                  McHale’s futurological studies of the 1970s (which were
                  addressed primarily to an audience of economists and
                  sociologists) were actually planted in the creative context of
                  the Independent Group.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn62" id="fnref62">62</a></sup>
                  With <em>Women in World Terms</em>, Cordell and her
                  collaborators were joining what was by that point already a
                  loud chorus pointing the finger against the paternalist
                  emphasis on domesticity and maternal nurturing that had
                  accompanied the turn to social welfare in the aftermath of the
                  Second World War.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn63" id="fnref63">63</a></sup>
                  Reproduction was elevated to become the “yardstick of womanly
                  virtue”, and women’s disenfranchised lives were filled with a
                  “highly dysfunctional” and “essentially false” cult of
                  motherhood.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn64" id="fnref64">64</a></sup>
                  In conclusion, they write, “we may posit that much of the
                  ‘reproductive ambition’ of women is socially inculcated and
                  maintained.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn65" id="fnref65">65</a></sup>
                  It is worth repeating one more time that Cordell (who never
                  had children of her own) had already expressed her feelings
                  about the cult of motherhood on canvas, where she had
                  repeatedly exposed reproduction as a site of
                  techno-imperialist colonization. Indeed, her paintings from
                  the 1950s strike a dystopian note, at odds with her own belief
                  in the powers of auto-repairing mechanisms, biological and
                  man-made. Not only do these works imply a grave critique of
                  nuclear life from sub-atomic to familial, but they also put
                  pressure on contemporary expectations for growth and
                  sustainability. True, they stage the event of biological
                  regeneration with ineluctable seriality, but each and every
                  single time they also bear the eco-nihilistic question of
                  whether it is wise to reproduce at all.

                        1920s, approximately £6 million per year was spent in
                        Britain on research and development between government
                        establishments, universities, and industrial
                        laboratories. Between the Second World War and the 1960s
                        the same figure shot up to £777.4 million.

                        Cordell denied the influence of Abstract Expressionism
                        on her technique. However, others have argued that it
                        was this exhibition, rather than the influence of
                        <em>Tachisme</em> and <em>Art informel</em>, that
                        prompted painters in Britain to take up synthetic
                        binders like polymer resin. These allowed them to paint
                        in gushes and straight from the can, with the canvas on
                        a horizontal plane. See Harriet A. L. Standeven, “The

                        changed drastically after 1957, when a fire in the

                        though often in a reactive rather than confrontational

                        relative reproductive autonomy through contraception was
                        matched by a new, psychoanalytically informed emphasis
                        on maternal duty. In a series of regular radio
                        broadcasts, psychoanalysts such as John Bowlby and
                        Donald Winnicott popularized the idea that women should
                        not choose career over family, insisting on natural
                        mothering as the lynchpin of the future sociality of the

                  Francis Harwood’s <em>Bust of a Man</em> (1758) is a
                  conversation starter—across time, across continents,&nbsp;across
                  collections, across disciplines. Some of those conversations
                  will be explored in this essay. There are two known copies of
                  the bust in museum collections. A signed and dated version,
                  likely to be the original, is held atop a sundrenched hill&nbsp;at
                  the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles (<a href="#clevensoncyangkgday-fig1">fig. 1</a>, right). A second, unsigned and undated, is at Yale Center
                  for British Art (YCBA) in New Haven, Connecticut, amidst its
                  Neo-Gothic campus (<a href="#clevensoncyangkgday-fig1">fig. 1</a>, left). For years both busts sat quietly in their respective
                  museum settings: the Getty’s Grand Tour gallery of mostly
                  white marble European sculpture (<a href="#clevensoncyangkgday-fig2">fig. 2</a>), and the YCBA’s display of eighteenth-century British
                  painting and sculpture, featuring portraits of affluent white
                  patrons. In each context the bust stands out, primarily due to
                  its sensuous blackness, but also because of the paucity of
                  information regarding its origins.

                  Although relatively few people might have seen Harwood’s busts
                  in the museum context, their images have been reproduced
                  broadly through print as well as public art. The Getty bust
                  has been displayed on a billboard created by artist Ken
                  Gonzales-Day in Los Angeles, and the Yale bust is prominently
                  featured on the cover of the third volume of the series,
                  <em>The Image of the Black in Western Art</em>, edited by
                  David Bindman and Henry Louis Gates, Jr. Both works are
                  accessible as digital images through the online collections of
                  the
                  <a href="#http-www-getty-edu-art-collection-objects-1199-francis-harwood-bust-of-a-man-english-1758" target="_blank">Getty</a>
                  and the
                  <a href="#http-collections-britishart-yale-edu-vufind-record-1669707" target="_blank">YCBA</a>. Yet this is the first time that the two busts have been
                  imaged together, and considered as objects in dialogue across
                  time and space. While they share many characteristics, the two
                  versions are not identical; artist Ken Gonzales-Day’s images&nbsp;
                  put them in conversation and ask us to take a closer look at
                  what appear to be doubles. Through this online format, the
                  works will have an enhanced digital life that will no doubt
                  spark other conversations about the media of their display.

                  The three contributors to this essay had each been studying
                  the busts separately—Cyra Levenson as co-curator, with
                  Meredith Gamer and Esther Chadwick, of an exhibition focused
                  on slavery and portraiture in eighteenth-century Britain,
                  Chi-ming Yang as a scholar of eighteenth-century globalization
                  and East–West relations, and Ken Gonzales-Day, whose
                  photographs and interview are included here, as an artist
                  exploring ethnographic portrait busts in museum collections.
                  To all of us, Harwood’s figures connect moments in time when
                  the contradictions of the raced body—its invisibility and
                  hypervisibility—might give rise to new ways of seeing and
                  feeling. To many contemporary viewers, the haptic blackness of
                  Harwood’s bust humanizes the work, at the same time that it
                  renders the bust an exception to the overwhelming images of
                  whiteness that populate the world of eighteenth-century art,
                  and museum spaces more generally. How and why does the
                  materiality of this work resonate so profoundly with
                  present-day audiences? How does the context of display shape
                  the ways we view each bust?
                </p>
                <p>
                  By putting into dialogue and holding in tension various
                  perspectives on the objects, we reframe their physicality. We
                  also address the construction of racial identities and racism
                  in these eighteenth-century busts that continue to resonate in
                  our present moment. How might we avoid the tendencies to
                  fragment, scrutinize, and objectify the black body? Looking at
                  the two busts in a shared frame redoubles our vision. It
                  highlights the ongoing social construction of black
                  masculinity as a type of exceptionalism—in both idealized and
                  denigrated forms. At the same time, the sensuality of these
                  figures interweaves the legacies of slavery, racial
                  construction, and collective resistances to institutional
                  racism.

                </h1>
                <p>
                  The faces of Harwood’s busts betray little emotion, but
                  details such as the slightly upturned head, forehead scar, and
                  wrinkle lines under the eyes invite speculation as to the
                  nobility of character under a range of possible circumstances.
                  The undulating black surface of the polished limestone brings
                  out the muscularity of the bare shoulders, chest, and torso;
                  the overall effect of the monochrome blackness is a sensuous
                  masculinity at once idealized and racially specific, even
                  realistic. Many viewers have commented that they recognize the
                  bust, and that it reminds them of someone they know. Its
                  august form refers it back in time to classical antiquity, yet
                  it also seems absolutely contemporary. The attention to detail
                  and specificity of its features contribute to a sense of its
                  individuality or personhood, despite the anonymity of the
                  original, eighteenth-century sitter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When comparing the two busts, perhaps the most obvious
                  difference is their surfaces. The scratchy veins on the Yale
                  bust indicate a dark though unpainted stone, although
                  technical analysis has not yet been done to determine its
                  material composition. Two heart-shaped pupils have been carved
                  into the eyes, which add a sense of definition and angularity
                  to the face, in comparison to the slightly broader visage of
                  the Getty bust. Certain questions remain unanswered. Why were
                  two busts made, and for whom was each intended? What journeys
                  did each undergo after leaving Harwood’s workshop? What
                  difference would it make if the signed, Getty bust were not
                  the original, but instead, either a lesser copy or a more
                  developed version of Yale’s?

                <p>
                  We do know that 1758 was a busy year for the workshop of the
                  expatriate British sculptor, Francis Harwood (1726/27–1783).
                  Since arriving in Florence, Italy, five years before, he had
                  established a reputation for copying antiques for patrons
                  eager to furnish their English homes with such illustrious
                  figures as Cicero, Julius Caesar, Marcus Aurelius, and Sappho.
                  In addition to these four commissioned works, in the same year
                  Harwood also completed a naturalistic, classicized bust of an
                  unnamed African man. Made during the height of the
                  transatlantic slave trade, the busts were unusual during the
                  period, and are still remarkable to behold. It is difficult to
                  know the extent to which, if at all, Harwood intended to
                  personalize an individual subject in response to the pervasive
                  de-humanization of Africans across European society. Such
                  naturalism certainly long predates the ethnographic depictions
                  of Africans by nineteenth-century artists like
                  Charles-Henri-Joseph Cordier (<a href="#clevensoncyangkgday-fig3">fig. 3</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  From 1865 up until 1922, the Getty bust was in the possession
                  of the descendants of Hugh Percy, the first Duke of
                  Northumberland. For this reason, the subject of the bust was
                  first thought to be an athlete named Psyche who was in the
                  service of the first duke. However, no Black servants were
                  employed by Northumberland before 1764. The sitter’s identity
                  has also been misattributed to the African-American boxer
                  <a href="#http-billrichmond-blogspot-com-2015-08-earl-george-percy-unveils-bill-richmond-html" target="_blank">Bill Richmond</a>
                  (1763–1829), who served the second Duke of Northumberland,
                  formerly Earl Percy (1742–1817), a Revolutionary War general;
                  but this took place long after the bust’s making. Other
                  theories point to a “savage” or captive warrior,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  the mythological Ethiopian king Memnon, or an allegorical
                  representation of Africa dubbed “<a href="#http-collections-britishart-yale-edu-vufind-record-1669707" target="_blank">Africus</a>”, but all similarly lack conclusive evidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Harwood himself is something of an enigma—despite his prolific
                  output, he has been described as "such stuff as footnotes
                  are made on".<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  He arrived in Rome in 1752, entered the Florentine Academy in
                  1755, and acquired the former studio of fellow sculptor
                  Giovanni Battista Piamontini (d. 1742) on the Via della
                  Sapienza in 1762. Harwood died in Florence in 1783, unusual
                  among his British peers for having established a career in
                  Italy and permanently resided there. He made a total of
                  thirteen portrait busts (a Homer was recently rediscovered in
                  Ireland in October 2014), and of these the
                  <em>Bust of a Man</em> (<a href="#clevensoncyangkgday-fig5">fig. 5</a>) is one of only two without classical precedents, the other
                  being that of

                  At the same time, the African figure’s bare chest and deep
                  torso is modelled on a type of classical nudity that Harwood
                  was not alone in reviving, as we can see in the Bust of Lord
                  Chesterfield (<a href="#clevensoncyangkgday-fig4">fig. 4</a>)
                  which was sculpted by his contemporary and friend, Joseph

                  Ultimately Harwood left behind a reputation for working with
                  polychrome marbles and fulfilling private commissions for
                  British aristocrats and expatriates. In addition to library
                  busts and statues, his workshop produced marbled funerary
                  monuments and tabletops, chimney pieces, vases and urns; in
                  other words, ornamental pieces to be incorporated into the
                  design ensemble of particular rooms. Unfortunately, we don’t
                  know where the <em>Bust of a Man</em> would have been placed
                  within its intended domestic interior, or how it would have
                  been coordinated with the other decorative elements.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  <a href="#edn1" id="ednref1"></a>Its status as a luxury
                  object, though, connects it to not only other portrayals of
                  people (along with individual patrons and artists), but also
                  to other things (furniture, marble, varnish).

                  Before Paul Mellon bought it in 1967, the Yale bust had been
                  part of the Esterhazy Collection in Vienna, where it was
                  misattributed to the Renaissance artist Alessandro Vittoria
                  (1525–1608) and called “The Blackamoor”, and in 2006 it became
                  part of the Yale Center for British Art collection. Though the
                  bust has been renamed, this tendency to read it as a
                  classicized “savage” type in the Italian blackamoor tradition
                  (<a href="#clevensoncyangkgday-fig7">fig. 7</a>) has
                  continued.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  <a href="#edn1" id="ednref1"></a>Such a conclusion, however,
                  captures neither the individuating and portrait-like features
                  of Harwood’s sculpture nor the changing attitudes towards
                  slavery and classicized representations of blackness. By the
                  mid-1750s, these attitudes were increasingly sensitive to
                  human suffering, even sentimental.

                  Nakedness, of course, does not necessarily signal savagery.
                  Paradoxically, in classical antiquity, sculptural nudity could
                  reference either a slave or a god. On the one hand, it deified
                  emperors like Caligula, Claudius, or Trajan and conquerors
                  like Alexander the Great. Neoclassical sculptors often
                  imitated such idealized “heroic or metaphorical nudity”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  On the other hand, an unclothed figure could represent a
                  slave, whose musculature would become an excuse to show off
                  anatomical detail. Slaves were thus often realistically or
                  sympathetically rendered. The sculptural tradition of figuring
                  slaves nude attests to the particularization of the experience
                  of slavery and suffering, as conveyed especially through
                  bodily and facial expressiveness. See, for example, statuary
                  such as the monumental
                  <a href="#http-www-wga-hu-html-m-l-longhena-pesaro-html" target="_blank">Atlas figures</a>
                  installed at the Frari Church in Venice (1665–69) by Melchior
                  Barthel (1625–1672), or the “<a href="#https-commons-wikimedia-org-wiki-monumento-dei-quattro-mori" target="_blank">Moors of Livorno</a>” (ca. 1623–26) by Pietro Tacca (1577–1640), which not only
                  express humanity and suffering, but were also modelled after
                  two individuals living in Italy, a Turkish galley slave named
                  Ali Salentino and an African man called Morgiano.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>

                  Although Harwood’s busts appear largely unprecedented in the
                  British context, in Florence, the place where he made his
                  career and home, Harwood was immersed in a Renaissance
                  tradition of depicting African boys and men in painting as
                  well as architecture. These Italian images include paintings
                  of Ethiopian Christians and Black magi from the twelfth to the
                  fourteenth centuries and countless portrayals of dark-skinned
                  pages dressed in livery. The ubiquity of the so-called “Moor”
                  in Italian culture inspired American artist Fred Wilson’s 2003
                  Venice Biennale installation, “<a href="#http-www-pacegallery-com-newyork-exhibitions-11160-venice-suite-sala-longhi-and-related-works" target="_blank">Speak of Me As I Am</a>.” In citing words spoken by Shakespeare’s now iconic
                  Othello, the Black Christian “Moor of Venice”, Wilson aimed to
                  give voice to a “Moro perspective” across history. Servants,
                  gondoliers, and other labourers were an active part of
                  Venetian life from the early 1500s, and the art of the period
                  indexes a long history of Mediterranean trade in goods and
                  slaves.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  Wilson compared these depictions to those of his own culture
                  and found: “When I look at the images of blacks in Venetian
                  Renaissance art, I see a humanity in the depictions that you
                  would not normally see in early American art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most common form of sculpture depicting the black figure
                  in the eighteenth century was decorative, blackamoor statuary
                  in the form of servile figures used as supports for chair arms
                  (<a href="#clevensoncyangkgday-fig6">fig. 6</a>) or
                  incorporated into doorknobs, candlesticks, and garden
                  fountains. Some are made of painted wood or stone, crudely
                  rendered and stiffly posed, holding up a platter, urn, or
                  vase, and many are dressed in Moorish or Turkish costume. The
                  popularity of these diminutive Moors and their “ornamental
                  blackness”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup><a href="#edn1" id="ednref1"></a> can be seen in the
                  construction of entire rooms such as the Château de Meudon’s
                  Salon des Maures later in the century, or the furniture suite
                  of carved stands and chairs in the Venetian palace,
                  <a href="#http-carezzonico-visitmuve-it-en-home" target="_blank">Ca’ Rezzonico</a>. However generic, these statues also point to the actual
                  black servants, often simply termed “Moors”, who worked as
                  pages, footmen, and valets de chambre and who were in fact
                  dressed in the Turkish-style feathered caps and turbans so
                  fashionable in the period. The Italian tradition of blackamoor
                  sculpture thus orientalized, reproduced, and updated classical
                  forms of ancient slavery (such as caryatids, which were also
                  based on real, Dacian captives) to resonate within an
                  eighteenth-century context of Atlantic slavery and servitude.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Blackamoor sculptures themselves were made with varying
                  degrees of realism, and some were humanized. Harwood’s bust
                  was more likely, though, a response to the crude figurations
                  of many Black people in art, and a response shared by
                  audiences who increasingly registered their disgust and
                  discomfort towards the upsetting depictions of suffering in
                  the shapes of classical atlantes or caryatids. As the
                  architect Isaac Ware wrote in 1756, “Men of rude genius . . .
                  represent them [slaves] crushed and sinking under the weight,
                  and think it a high degree of merit, if they can figure in
                  their sculpture starting eyes or bursting sinews.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                  Such objections to classical, sculptural representations of
                  slaves attest to the perceived realism of the works, on the
                  one hand, and the viewer’s acknowledgment of the real bodies
                  and experiences of contemporary slaves referenced by these
                  works, on the other. Amidst a developing culture of
                  sensibility, suffering was becoming distasteful. Though the
                  abolitionist movement was still several decades away, already
                  philosophers like Adam Smith were positing ideas of universal
                  moral sympathy. As Smith wrote in his
                  <em>Theory of Moral Sentiments</em> of 1759: “How selfish
                  soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some
                  principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of
                  others.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>

                  Today at the Getty (as at Yale) Harwood’s sculpture is titled,
                  “Bust of a Man”. Its name has changed over the last two
                  decades, reflecting a history of increasing institutional
                  sensitivity about race, and at the same time a subtle
                  re-inscription of blackness as a type of racial alterity. In
                  1987, when Christie’s purchased the bust from a private
                  dealer, it was called “Bust of a negro”, and referred to also
                  as “Bust of a Blackman”. At this point art dealers assumed the
                  sitter’s identity to be an eighteenth-century servant and
                  athlete named Psyche. In one catalogue advertisement it was
                  dubbed “The Property of a Gentleman”,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>
                  and in another, “The athlete that outpaced the aesthetes” (<a href="#clevensoncyangkgday-fig8">fig. 8</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
                  The value of the bust was thus articulated respectively with
                  the language of the slave trade, and the commodification and
                  superior performance of black bodies in sports. We should also
                  note that the client for whom it was sold by Christie’s (for
                  the high price of £99,000) had wanted it out of his own house
                  because “it was so ugly and terrifying that his children
                  became frightened.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup><a href="#edn3" id="ednref3"></a> Such a reaction could
                  have been taken straight from a page of eighteenth-century
                  aesthetics, as in Edmund Burke’s description in 1757 of the
                  sublime terror (“Darkness Terrible in Its Own Nature”) invoked
                  by a “negro” woman’s body in the eyes of an impressionable
                  white child.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>
                  This denigration of the bust seems a far cry from its current
                  status as an exquisite, or at least exotic thing of beauty
                  that has been included in special exhibits at Tate Britain and
                  the Palazzo Pitti, and placed alongside works by luminaries
                  Joseph Nollekens, Joseph Wilton, and Antonio Canova.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After its arrival at the Getty Museum in 1988, the work was
                  catalogued as “Bust of a Black Man”. By 1990, the
                  distinguishing qualifier “Black” had been removed, in part due
                  to staff and visitors’ objections, and no doubt in an effort
                  to correct the racism that had framed it in the past. The
                  adjective “black” currently reappears twice in the caption,
                  however: “Sculptor Francis Harwood chose a black stone to
                  reproduce the sitter’s skin tone”, and “This work may be one
                  of the earliest sculpted portraits of a Black individual by a
                  European.” To be sure, differentiating between a lower-case
                  “black” colour and an upper-case “Black” person of African
                  descent follows a laudable grammatical practice—and a point of
                  <a href="#http-www-nytimes-com-2014-11-19-opinion-the-case-for-black-with-a-capital-b-html" target="_blank">ongoing debate</a>—that aims to recognize the proper humanity of a people
                  through the standard of capitalization. In this essay, we have
                  chosen to capitalize the term when a person (rather than a
                  concept, figure, or object) is being referenced. In the above
                  example of the museum label, one unintended consequence of
                  designating the stone “black” is a curious essentializing and
                  racializing of the material itself. It is as though the
                  floating signifier of blackness has been transferred from the
                  identity of the subject onto the physical object and its
                  making.

                  Today, a visitor to the Getty Museum reading the bust’s label
                  might easily assume that the colour of the marble is naturally
                  black. In fact, the glossy colour that strikes our eyes (<a href="#clevensoncyangkgday-fig9">fig. 9</a>), especially from a distance, is a result of the application
                  of black gouache paint and varnish to a matt, tan, sandy
                  limestone nowhere near black. Scientifically speaking, this
                  stone is unusual; it contains a high variation of colours and
                  embedded minerals when examined closely, though the samples of
                  the bust tested by Getty conservation staff were too small to
                  determine the type of stone (whether pietra da paragone,
                  Belgian Black, or Nero di Colonnata) or where it might have
                  been quarried.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>
                  Variation is of course apparent upon close scrutiny of any
                  marble, coloured or white (let us remember that whiteness,
                  too, is constructed), and clearly the artist intended an
                  overall effect of the dark stone to reference coloured skin.
                  Yet the conservation work and analysis shows that the bust’s
                  original, eighteenth-century coating was a medium, translucent
                  brown. In fact, conservators have in recent years removed much
                  of the thickly applied black paint, wax, and shellac that had
                  been applied to the bust in the 1980s, in an attempt to bring
                  the surface colour closer to the varied texture and tone of
                  the underlying marble.

                <p>
                  Heeding the bust’s constructed blackness reminds us of the
                  social construction of race more generally; it helps us
                  question the particularizing tendency to read and interpret
                  identities, human or representational, at surface level, even
                  to the extent that we project these assumptions of race onto
                  non-human matter. The danger of equating a naturally black
                  stone with the biological race of an individual can also be
                  seen in the scholarly argument that African subjects were
                  merely an excuse for an artist to work with rare and difficult
                  materials such as black marble.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>
                  The difficulty of working with black material to render flesh
                  tones across a range of arts, including dyeing and oil
                  painting, have too often led critics to celebrate the
                  virtuosity of the artisan at the expense of even considering
                  the dehumanizing practices of art making and aesthetics.
                  Nineteenth-century sculptor Charles-Henri-Joseph Cordier used
                  newly quarried, precious materials like coloured Algerian onyx
                  to create his ethnographic portrait masterpieces; and yet,
                  this was a resource extracted as part of an imperial agenda of
                  the Napoleonic state, as trenchantly studied by James
                  Smalls.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>
                  Paying attention to the materials of representation and the
                  ecology of colonialism also nuances the history of racial
                  representations. After all, colour has a political as well as
                  an aesthetic history.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sculptors like Harwood welcomed the creative challenge of
                  carving hard, coloured stones. He also catered to a demand for
                  colour in interior design; and the lustratori, or artisans who
                  typically cleaned and polished the final pieces are likely to
                  have played a critical role in creating the haptic, glossy
                  artefacts that held so much allure. The interplay of colours
                  and textures reflects a culture taken with the imitation of
                  luxurious surfaces such as porcelain, marble, and
                  tortoiseshell.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">22</a></sup>
                  Glossy blackness was associated with Roman copies of classical
                  polychrome sculptures made of black-green basanite; in the
                  Ptolemaic era of Hellenistic Egypt, a limestone sculpture of a
                  seated African boy might, like Harwood’s limestone bust, be
                  varnished to “produce the glossy appearance of skin”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">23</a></sup>
                  In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, black shine also
                  referenced the vogue for imported Japanese and Chinese lacquer
                  and shellac, a varnishing substance we find in the original
                  coating of the Getty’s Harwood bust.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">24</a></sup>
                  From another perspective, the glossy blackness of Harwood’s
                  portrait also echoed the slaving practice of subjecting
                  peoples to being oiled to heighten their value and healthy
                  appearance on the human market. The cruel irony here is that
                  the expendability of actual labouring, sweating bodies runs
                  counter to the ideal of perfectly preserved, aesthetic
                  surfaces used to represent black skin and to showcase the
                  virtuosic artistry and technical sophistication demanded by
                  eighteenth-century European consumers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the case of Harwood’s busts, equating human skin colour
                  with the blackness of the stone essentializes both human and
                  stone. When the material is itself rare or “exotic”, the
                  fascination with it creates comparative registers across media
                  and between different orders of colour—both racial and
                  ornamental. Thus a person’s cultural identity can be projected
                  onto stone, and the “naturalness” of the stone can reinforce
                  the essential alterity of the figure.

                  Undoubtedly, the racialized blackness of Harwood’s marble bust
                  adds to its exemplarity. The colour appears at once to
                  humanize and to objectify. This tension between its
                  particularity and generality—its duality as modern portrait
                  and classical type—is in fact a feature of the broader genre
                  of the eighteenth-century sculptural portrait.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">25</a></sup>
                  Harwood’s case is complicated by the question of the sitter’s
                  identity. Was the hypothetical subject a slave or a free man?
                  Do we consider this work a “slave portrait”, a “particular
                  individual”, a “particular likeness”, or a “particularizing
                  portrait”?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">26</a></sup>
                  These are all efforts to address, in different ways,
                  art-historical debates over distinguishing a portrait from a
                  type. David Bindman argues that the very idea of a “slave
                  portrait” is an oxymoron, that is, that slavery is premised on
                  the denial of a person’s subjecthood, whereas portraiture
                  celebrates an individual subject. Yet, too often the focus on
                  an individual’s identity can shut down conversation around the
                  work’s social impact and obfuscate the broader context in
                  which a likeness is constructed and makes meaning. Refusing
                  the binary between the singular portrait and the generic type,
                  Agnes Lugo-Ortiz and Angela Rosenthal soundly argue that
                  portraits, too, follow conventions, and by no means guarantee
                  singularity. With respect to slave portraiture, even the most
                  racist, scientific, and ethnographic images can subvert their
                  intended function “if the information contained in or excited
                  by the image exceeds its frame of discursive intentions”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">27</a></sup>
                  We take their lead in studying the distinguishing features of
                  Harwood’s busts as at once idealized and naturalized, singular
                  and generic; in fact, the combination of these extremes, held
                  in tension, imbues the work with its signifying power.

                  In the Fall of 2015 the YCBA version of the Harwood bust
                  became the centre of an exhibition (<a href="#clevensoncyangkgday-fig10">fig. 10</a>) motivated by the idea that a portrait might be defined less
                  in terms of a likeness, or even a particularizing
                  representation, and more as itself an encounter between sitter
                  and artist, image and viewer. Titled
                  <em><a href="#http-britishart-yale-edu-exhibitions-figures-empire-slavery-and-portraiture-eighteenth-century-atlantic-britain" target="_blank">Figures of Empire</a>: Slavery and Portraiture in Eighteenth-Century Atlantic
                    Britain</em>, and co-curated by Cyra Levenson, Meredith Gamer and Esther
                  Chadwick, the exhibition&nbsp;examined the ways that
                  eighteenth-century Britons negotiated their relationship with
                  slavery through portraiture. The Harwood bust was placed in
                  the centre of the gallery amongst approximately sixty
                  paintings, sculptures, prints, drawings, and decorative
                  objects drawn from Yale’s collections (<a href="#clevensoncyangkgday-fig11">figs. 11</a>
                  and <a href="#clevensoncyangkgday-fig12">12</a>). Most of the
                  black figures in the exhibition were portrayed in paintings
                  alongside white sitters. In portraiture, qualities that
                  eighteenth-century Britons valued—freedom, whiteness, and
                  refinement—were imagined in opposition to the bondage and
                  blackness of those who arrived in Britain from Africa or the
                  Caribbean as slaves. The exhibition challenged viewers to
                  consider all of the figures depicted as subjects with
                  histories and as “figures of empire”—as people whose lives
                  shaped and were shaped by Britain’s imperial world.

                <p>
                  The physical centrality of the bust of a dignified Black man
                  provided a different frame of reference for viewing the other
                  objects in the exhibition space, creating new dialogues
                  between visitors and works of art. Life-size, solid, and
                  three-dimensional, the bust met one’s gaze at eye level. It
                  presented a free-standing Black man in the eighteenth century
                  depicted not in the shadow of a white subject, but on his own.
                  The bust also became the catalyst for a series of revelatory
                  connections made by viewers linking our racial present and our
                  slavery past. How do we challenge ourselves to see the unnamed
                  black figures painted during the eighteenth century as
                  individuals with histories despite their anonymity? During the
                  course of the exhibition, artist Fred Wilson gave a talk and
                  then led a discussion in the galleries. As someone who has
                  worked with the vexed imagery of slavery for most of his
                  career, he wondered at first whether he would have anything
                  new to say about objects with which he was so familiar. It was
                  the juxtaposition of the bust and the
                  <a href="#http-collections-britishart-yale-edu-vufind-record-1669237" target="_blank">portrayal of a young boy as a page by Sir Joshua
                    Reynolds</a>
                  hanging on the wall behind it (see
                  <a href="#clevensoncyangkgday-fig11">fig. 11</a>) that caught
                  his attention. Wilson noted that he had never considered boys
                  such as the one in the painting growing up into adults. The
                  Harwood bust became a way to imagine a future for the boy in
                  the painting, how he might become a man with stature and
                  presence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the centre of the exhibition, the Harwood bust also asked
                  viewers to imagine a life story for the figure while
                  respecting the limits of what we can ever know. As such, it
                  seemed to invite a direct and personal connection, an ability
                  to solicit what queer theorist Carolyn Dinshaw has termed “the
                  touch across time”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">28</a></sup>
                  Nell Painter, historian, author, and artist participated in a
                  <a href="#http-www-centerforbritishart-org-slavery-and-portraiture-audio" target="_blank">podcast interview</a>
                  that placed the bust in the context of the lived experiences
                  of the eighteenth century. Her personal response to the bust
                  was equally powerful. As she remarked, “when I first saw this
                  sculpture . . . I blurted out, this is the artists’
                  boyfriend!” She went on:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    the piece is so tenderly beautiful, so caressingly detailed
                    of face and shoulders that it can only be of a particular
                    person . . . not allegory, not myth, he is someone well
                    known to the artist and I figure someone well loved. Now
                    that I have spent time, I recognize this person, or someone
                    he closely resembles.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Painter’s response makes explicit the bust’s captivating
                  eroticism. As discussed above, we know so little of the exact
                  circumstances involved in its making. Isn’t it likely that
                  there was a relationship or interaction of some kind between
                  the sitter and the sculptor? Clearly they spent time together,
                  and this physicality and sense of touch is expressed through
                  the attention paid to the surface of the skin and the bust’s
                  musculature. This layered encounter with the bust—imagining
                  its history while simultaneously projecting one’s own history
                  onto it—is envisioned not as an incongruity but as an
                  acknowledgment of what the field of psychology calls
                  “confirmation bias”. We see what we know and what we are
                  prepared to understand; this is not a shortcoming, but a
                  fundamental aspect of human perception and knowledge
                  production.

                  Echoing the scholarly discussions of portraits as
                  particularizing representations, high school students who
                  visited the exhibition were often able to interpret the bust
                  as both an individual and a representative image, and did not
                  experience this as a contradiction. Whether narrating a
                  personal or collective history, the bust, in their eyes,
                  exists in relation to others. One student wrote: “I see to the
                  day this sculpture was made. By his posture and smirk I feel
                  this man is proud to be representing something, whether it’s
                  he or a group. . . . Maybe he was a part of something special?
                  Maybe that’s why he and the artist worked to make this bust?”
                  Another student picked up on the idea of portrait as
                  encounter: “His eyes portray little about his life, yet seem
                  to tell us so much about the day the sculpture was created.”
                  She is as much focused on the interaction between artist and
                  sitter as she is on the narrative of the bust.

                  One could argue that depictions of people, including
                  portraits, are created to invite us to imagine. This is not a
                  new notion. It was put forward by anti-slavery art and
                  activism premised on the very possibility of fellow feeling
                  and universal kinship. Perhaps the most familiar black icon of
                  the British eighteenth century is Josiah Wedgwood’s
                  abolitionist ceramic medallion of 1787 of an enchained,
                  kneeling slave pictured in profile and applied in relief, who
                  pleads the words of the caption, “<a href="#http-www-bbc-co-uk-history-british-abolition-africans-in-art-gallery-02-shtml" target="_blank">Am I not a Man and a Brother?</a>”. He is a contained figure—miniaturized, suppliant, and
                  generic. Nonetheless, the sentimental appeal of the image led
                  to its instant reproduction in the form of tokens, bracelets,
                  plates, and even snuffboxes. Even earlier, Sir Joshua Reynolds
                  in his fourth discourse of 1769 argued: “there must be
                  something either in the action or in the object in which men
                  are universally concerned, and which powerfully strikes upon
                  the public sympathy.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">29</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In its public display, having moved from the margins to the
                  centre of the space, Harwood’s bust has played a pivotal role
                  in framing the changing meaning of objects across time, and in
                  reckoning with uncomfortable notions of the past while also
                  allowing new meanings to be created. Especially when shown
                  together, these pictorial representations of slavery in
                  portraiture ultimately fail to dehumanize their subjects and
                  instead allow us to see individuals in relationships of
                  intimacy and in negotiation with power.

                  Whereas each of Harwood’s busts is an anomaly within its own
                  museum setting, when studied in relation to each other they
                  also enable a fuller consideration of the individual
                  representation not only as a type, but also as one among
                  countless other unnamed Black Europeans of the eighteenth
                  century. Acknowledging the limits of the positivist,
                  historicist impulse to identify the real person, and hence the
                  objective truth of the work of art, also helpfully redirects
                  us to its affective realities. That is, we can begin to ask
                  how the object invites us to look, and how its ambiguities
                  disrupt the “grammar of violence”—to borrow a term from
                  Saidiya Hartman—of a slaving society premised on
                  eighteenth-century notions of personhood.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">30</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Black is a colour with a history.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">31</a></sup>
                  Even while it cannot be simply reduced to one colour among
                  other colours, activating the metonymic play of its
                  signification across history and in linguistic and material
                  registers—between blackamoor, black stone, and Black man—might
                  help unfix some of the constrictions of essentialism. We have
                  suggested that the interplay of universal and particular
                  undergirds the bust’s power and enigma as a portrait; yet we
                  are less concerned with parsing the difference between
                  portrait and type, as we are with understanding our ways of
                  seeing, categorizing, and disciplining the eighteenth-century
                  past. Philosophies of racism can help illuminate the social
                  implications of the contradictions embodied by the Harwood
                  busts. Whereas racism is usually seen as an extreme form of
                  particularism, the philosopher Étienne Balibar posed the
                  question: how might racism be aligned with universalism
                  through its reliance on, rather than merely exclusion of,
                  essential differences? By extension, do we, by classifying
                  portraiture as the container of the elusive ideal of
                  singularity, inadvertently uphold a system of ideal types,
                  indeed valorize “a desire for knowledge which becomes
                  fulfilled by a system of differential categories”?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">32</a></sup>
                  To return to the question of the bust’s “Blackened” blackness,
                  we might adapt Balibar’s provocation of “racism as
                  universalism” and posit racism as anthropomorphism. In other
                  words, assigning blackness to the human and projecting the
                  biases of the social onto the inanimate—such as the
                  stone—makes matter speak as though it were an objective,
                  living truth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, it is as though we want the bust to speak; to be a
                  Black superhero that has travelled through time and withstood
                  the ravages of history. To a current-day audience, the
                  materiality of the Harwood busts animates the history, indeed
                  the matter, of Black life. It reassures us that “black is
                  beautiful” at a moment when the mantra of “Black Lives Matter”
                  asserts, tragically, what should be a given rather than an
                  exception. In this way, the bust is a modelled minority, and
                  an icon of sorts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">33</a></sup>
                  Icons are made in order to fill a social or institutional
                  need, and their fetishized exceptionalism can become as
                  limiting as the invisibility of the raced subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is the space between and around the busts that defines
                  their blackness, particularly when they are photographed.
                  Between 2008 and 2009, artist Ken Gonzales-Day created a body
                  of work centred on the Getty’s version of Harwood’s bust . He
                  selected the object because it resonated with themes in his
                  own work such as the construction of race, the history of
                  physiognomy and classical standards of beauty, and the history
                  of scientific racism and museum display. His resulting
                  photographs, the “Profile Series”, placed the bust in dialogue
                  with the Getty collection in new ways, raising questions about
                  the racial and racist underpinnings of sculpting, indeed of
                  profiling, the human figure. One of the images, which pairs
                  the Harwood Bust with a European Bust of a Young Man
                  (Untitled, by Antico [Pier Jacopo Alari Bonacolsi]) was
                  featured on a public billboard in Los Angeles as part of the
                  citywide exhibit, in February and March of 2010. By
                  transporting the image outside and beyond the museum, the bust
                  is at once flattened and made newly interactive. In
                  orchestrating a face-off between the two black figures, who
                  share a colour though not a race, the work makes evident the
                  need for radical juxtapositions and critical re-framings of
                  the object (<a href="#clevensoncyangkgday-fig13">fig. 13</a>).
                  Just as the spaces we have explored here—museum display,
                  artist and audience encounters, scholarly debates—are subject
                  to change, so we continue the conversation in the photo-essay
                  and interview with Gonzales-Day, in the hopes of generating
                  further dialogue. For onto the bust is projected not only our
                  knowledge of the past, but also the productive gaps which
                  remain.

                  <p>
                    Could you describe how you first encountered the Harwood
                    bust? What drew you to it?
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  I was a Visiting Scholar (and artist-in-residence) at the
                  Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles. I used to walk past
                  the Harwood sculpture quite often and I remember being rather
                  struck one day by its location, near a passageway. It was in a
                  room with life-size white marble sculptures of
                  <em>Venus</em> (1773), <em>Minerva</em> (1775), and
                  <em>Juno</em> (1776), by Joseph Nollekens and Joseph Wilton’s
                  white marble <em>Bust of a Man</em> (1758), and
                  <em>Bust of Pseudo-Seneca</em> (1755–65). There was also
                  <em>Faun Holding a Goat</em> by an unknown Frenchman, a herm,
                  another portrait bust, and perhaps unintentionally, Francis
                  Harwood’s <em>Bust of a Man</em> seemed to be gazing directly
                  towards a rather lithe marble figure of
                  <em>Apollo Crowning Himself</em> (1781–82) by Antonio Canova.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a small mountain’s worth of white marble, this was the only
                  depiction of race that I could see. A black male bust carved
                  in black stone, with broad shoulders, a bare chest and the
                  muscular definition of a superhero. It was, and is, a striking
                  figure, but what surprised me most was the speed at which
                  viewers passed by and scarcely gave it a glance. It occurred
                  to me that this was a rather remarkable room and I went there
                  often. His name was not known. There was also no explanation
                  of how he came to be there, in Los Angeles, at the J. Paul
                  Getty Museum, nor of how he might relate to the other sculpted
                  figures in the room. This is not a criticism of the museum
                  display but an observation. To most viewers, he was a man
                  without a past, out of context, perched high upon a pedestal
                  well above eye level. He was literally and figuratively
                  isolated from the pulsing flow of visitors who walked in a
                  steady stream past him on their way to the nearby elevated
                  garden with a spectacular view of the city—steep competition
                  for sure, particularly at such a well-known tourist
                  destination.

                  It was after this experience that I altered my then current
                  project at the Getty, and decided to photograph every portrait
                  bust in the J. Paul Getty Museum as a way of thinking about
                  sculptural depictions of race and whiteness. It is true that I
                  could perhaps have simply purchased a museum catalogue, or
                  searched the collection database online, but for my project I
                  wanted to see these objects, to witness their presence, their
                  scale, their surfaces, and to create a body of work from that
                  experience. The project was so massive that the Getty extended
                  my time there to allow me to complete the project, and I
                  should say that none of it would have been possible without
                  the support of the Getty Research Institute, the museum and
                  security staff.

                    This is a method and genre question: why make photographic
                    images of existing art works, and how does what you do
                    differ from documentary photography? How would you describe
                    your aesthetic vocabulary?
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  There is a larger question here about whether or not these
                  photographs can or should be seen as part of a documentary
                  project. I can say that unlike a museum photographer working
                  to document an object for an exhibition catalogue, I am not
                  bound by the rules, which is to say that a conventional
                  documentary image may simply wish to present the sculpture as
                  objectively as possible, so that the work will be well lit and
                  recognizable. However, I often use lighting or my angle of
                  view as a way of highlighting specific aspects of the object,
                  perhaps drawing attention to a profile or trait that has been
                  foregrounded by the sculptor. More than this, however, is the
                  existence of the series as a whole, since it now includes well
                  over one thousand objects. It is both an archive and a form of
                  agency, and in fact many of the objects that I have
                  photographed are rarely or never placed on view, and so in
                  many ways, the work it has produced may be the only way many
                  viewers will ever be able to experience these objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is also the issue of experiencing these works in
                  sometimes vastly different contexts than those imagined by
                  their creators. For example, how might our interpretation of a
                  work change if it were presented as scientific evidence of
                  human difference, or as an example of individual
                  self-expression, an artistic style, directed by a
                  commissioning body, or the product of a historic period? As
                  with so many of these contested objects, context is everything
                  and nothing, at the same time.

                    What were some of the challenges of photographing this bust
                    in particular, and of sculpture in general?
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  On a technical level, the Harwood bust is a challenging work
                  to photograph precisely because it is so dark and shiny. From
                  nearly every angle it catches reflections on its highly
                  polished surface. In addition, it was, and is, on a very high
                  pedestal and so I had to stand very precariously on a
                  stepladder and try to manipulate a very old 8x10 Deardorff
                  camera to get the shot. Lastly of course, I was only able to
                  photograph in the galleries on Mondays when the museum is
                  closed to the public, so it actually took many weeks to get
                  the right shot. At the Yale Center for British Art, I had
                  additional challenges in not being able to control the
                  lighting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In general, the greatest challenge with photographing
                  sculpture is trying to get access to the objects, working
                  around museum hours, and also photographing something that
                  often cannot be moved.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On a more conceptual level, all photographers take pictures,
                  but in this case, they are pictures of someone else’s artwork.
                  So the challenge for me is often to try to capture something
                  particular about a given sculpture, just as one might try to
                  capture something unique or telling about a person in a
                  portrait. In my case, I was trying to understand why a given
                  feature might have been given emphasis by the sculptor. In
                  some cases, I would dramatically alter the conventional
                  lighting of the sculpture to “uncover” some quality or feature
                  not present in the museum presentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, I might shoot one sculpture to foreground an
                  idealized treatment of the face, while in another I might
                  focus on a highly detailed treatment of facial features, like
                  wrinkles in eighteenth-century terracotta portrait busts, to
                  highlight a particular fascination with character analysis
                  present in that time period.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I think for me there was also a conceptual level which allowed
                  me to look at all these representations as just that, as
                  representations that could be studied, considered, and that
                  such considerations could be used to create a new work of art
                  that would do a different kind of work than those articulated
                  in the original object. What does race look like? What does
                  whiteness look like? What other factors might also be a play?
                  And so on.

                    What kind of digital enhancement or technical manipulation,
                    for example, through lighting, went into the construction of
                    the jet-black colour of the Harwood bust? What were you
                    hoping to achieve by highlighting its blackness?
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The image was produced in black and white in order to reduce
                  the material differences between the objects juxtaposed and
                  the colour or treatment of the stone in particular. In a way
                  it was also a response to the question and ongoing debate or
                  discussion about which of the two Harwood busts came first. I
                  was wondering how much the ordering of their production would
                  change their significance, and asking myself, what could their
                  differences tell us, and how might that change depending on
                  which one came first? For example, the scar and hair are
                  treated very differently in both of the sculptures, so much so
                  that they could easily be seen as two different works. Then
                  there is the choice of material, the treatment of the
                  shoulders and the back, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So rather than simply anaesthetizing what are very different
                  and beautiful surfaces I wanted to create a work that might
                  sketch out a different set of questions than those I had been
                  hearing. It was also intended to encourage the viewer to
                  consider the very question of demarcation itself, the
                  mark-making that is sculpture.

                  On a technical level, the Harwood bust is a challenging work
                  to photograph precisely because it is so dark and shiny. From
                  nearly every angle it catches reflections on its highly
                  polished surface. In addition, it was, and is, on a very high
                  pedestal and so I had to stand very precariously on a
                  stepladder and try to manipulate a very old 8x10 Deardorff
                  camera to get the shot. Lastly of course, I was only able to
                  photograph in the galleries on Mondays when the museum is
                  closed to the public, so it actually took many weeks to get
                  the right shot. At the Yale Center for British Art, I had
                  additional challenges in not being able to control the
                  lighting.

                  Did Harwood humanize the figure more in one than the other,
                  did he racialize one more than the other, were there specific
                  distinct locations imagined for each sculpture? Here, we can
                  think of the backs of the sculptures. One seems to have been
                  intended for a niche or alcove. And for myself, I was also
                  wondering about the differences in the way the objects are
                  displayed. Location, lighting, and even height, all impact my
                  perception of the work. Is one more accurate than the other?
                  Are they sculptural types or portraits? And what critical
                  tools can we use to distinguish the similarities and
                  differences between them?
                </p>
                <p>
                  In eliminating the colour, I wanted to draw attention to the
                  form. I also brought the contrast levels closer together
                  because they were taken in very different lighting conditions.
                  To my eye they look very different, and these marks of
                  difference seem to want to tell another story, one beyond the
                  individual depicted, and one beyond which came first. I wanted
                  the image to remind us that each work was the result of
                  physical acts, created in different moments, which when
                  brought together, might add up to more than a literal
                  description of light on stone in a still evolving narrative
                  that is very much tied to the present: tied to what is
                  visible, and what can never be visible.

                    Juxtaposition plays a big role in your image-making, often a

                <p>
                  Juxtaposition allows the works to create new dialogues. It
                  often literally creates an empty or open space between
                  objects, which the viewer can then fill with their own
                  questions or answers. It is a generative space. It marks a
                  potential; a site for dialogue; it can stand in for time; it
                  can be the space between texts. This de-contextualization can
                  sometimes help to raise questions about racial formation,
                  gender normativity, and any number of other topics. Lastly, of
                  course, this juxtaposition is a way to give the objects life
                  again. It allows them to enter into current debates. Many of
                  the objects I photograph are quite remarkable and so even
                  though the context in which they came into being may have
                  changed, shifted, or even become unrecognizable, there is no
                  reason why we cannot still productively engage with them. One
                  need only think of the recent media coverage on police
                  violence to be reminded that the discussion of race and racial
                  profiling is anything but a thing of the past.

                  It was after photographing the Harwood bust at the Getty that
                  I also began looking for and photographing other sculptural
                  depictions of race, including works by Charles-Henri-Joseph
                  Cordier (1827–1905) and Malvina Hoffman as well as the Harwood
                  bust held at the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven. So,
                  yes, it set me on a path to photograph more works by other
                  artists and in different kinds of collections, ultimately
                  drawing on both the fine arts and the sciences as a way of
                  re-thinking the role three-dimensional work has contributed to
                  our understanding of race within museums and beyond.

                          Spanish, Chinese, and English. She specializes in the

                          the early modern period to the 18th century, and up to
                          the contemporary moment. Her scholarship is
                          interdisciplinary and comparative in approach,
                          crossing the bounds of British, American, Asian, and

                          include: transatlantic/transpacific exchanges; science

                          the European fascination with Asia. It examines how
                          China became an intensely debated example of virtue
                          amidst England’s new consumer culture. Her new work
                          concerns race, chinoiserie, transatlantic slavery, and
                          the cultural impact of global flows of silver between
                          Latin America and East Asia.

                  Can there be such a thing as “Arts and Crafts” painting? This
                  article will address that question by interrogating the points
                  of connection between Pre-Raphaelite painting and the Arts and
                  Crafts object. Taking its cue from William Morris’s reflection
                  on the “English Pre-Raphaelite School” from 1891, this article
                  examines the interplay between painting and design in both
                  Pre-Raphaelite painting and the Arts and Crafts movement. It
                  addresses the ways in which paintings depicted decorative art,
                  as well as the aspiration of decorative art to the symbolic
                  potential traditionally associated with painting. It is my
                  contention that Pre-Raphaelite painting unleashed a radical
                  possibility for decorative art: the Arts and Crafts belief in
                  the political agency of things.

                  In 1889, the artist and designer Walter Crane summarized the
                  goals of the Arts and Crafts movement with a poem entitled
                  “The Craftsman’s Dream”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;In sixty-five stanzas, this poem encapsulates the ideals of
                  the movement in which Crane played a vital role, as he
                  describes what happens when an unemployed craftsman wanders
                  into a museum and strolls through the galleries admiring the
                  decorative arts on display. Crane planned to publish an
                  illustrated edition which was never realized: a drawing for
                  the frontispiece shows the craftsman at the beginning of his
                  visit, facing off with an Egyptian sphinx (<a href="#moneill-fig1">fig. 1</a>). This object and other physical traces of the past,
                  characterized as remnants of “golden ages”, inspire and
                  inform. And yet the craftsman cannot escape a sense of
                  despair, even in his admiration, that such wonders should be
                  “cast aside” from use and imprisoned in museum cases.

                  What happens next in the poem is surprising: after
                  contemplating the decorative arts of the past, the craftsman
                  comes upon a painting that decorates the walls of the museum.
                  And this is not just any painting; it is an imaginative
                  projection of his thoughts onto the canvas, a proto-cinematic
                  kaleidoscope of shifting scenes. What begins as a barren
                  landscape painting quickly transforms into a battle scene, as
                  bands of artists and workers, assisted by figures from history
                  and mythology, defeat a monstrous Capitalist and his minions.
                  In a second planned illustration, Crane depicted the
                  Capitalist astride a decorated mount (<a href="#moneill-fig2">fig. 2</a>). He wears the armour of industrialism and the helmet of the
                  factory, a “stove-pipe” hat that Crane would later describe as
                  “the crown of the modern king, the financier—the business
                  man—he who must be obeyed”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Capitalist is also referred to as “The Philistine”. He is
                  an accumulator of “sordid spoils” from “ruined lands” who
                  cares only for the monetary value of art and not at all for
                  its historical conditions or symbolic purpose. The craftsman
                  imagines victory for the workers, and the painting once again
                  transforms, this time into a depiction of the ideal society.
                  In this utopia, art unites utility and beauty, and thus
                  liberates all workers, including the artist: “for styles and
                  learning vexed them not/ But, singing at his craft, each one,/
                  Was happy in his working lot.” With these lines, Crane alludes
                  to the goals of the Arts and Crafts movement, as well as its
                  politics. It is significant in this regard that “The
                  Craftsman’s Dream” did not appear in an artistic journal but
                  was published in the <em>Labour Leader</em>, a socialist
                  newspaper.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Crane’s poem summarizes Arts and Crafts ideals: a protest
                  against industrial manufacture and an attempt to make daily
                  life more beautiful inspired by, but not in imitation of, the
                  best examples of past art. Looking to the past as a way to
                  critique the present and imagine the future was a popular
                  trope in socialist writing of this period, especially in
                  William Morris’s <em>A Dream of John Ball</em> from 1888.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>&nbsp;The disjunctive temporality of “The Craftsman’s Dream” is
                  also indebted to the writings of John Ruskin. The poem signals
                  Crane’s admiration for Ruskin’s praise of the Gothic
                  stonemason in <em>The Stones of Venice</em> (1851–3), a text
                  that provided aesthetic and moral justifications for
                  preferring handicraft to mass-produced decoration in the age
                  of industrial manufacture. That text in particular championed
                  the individual creative impulse, set in opposition to the
                  contemporary urge to make man into a machine. The espousal of
                  craftsmanship led to a further critique of political economy
                  in Ruskin’s <em>Unto this Last</em> (1862). His promotion of
                  craftsmanship and the concomitant denigration of
                  industrialization, along with his assertion of the public
                  function of art, influenced the political development of not
                  only artists but an entire community of English
                  socialists.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>&nbsp;William Morris in particular transformed Ruskin’s ideas into
                  a type of artisanal socialism.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>&nbsp;The question remains, however, as to why Crane selected
                  <em>painting</em> as the transformative artistic medium in his
                  dream of the craftsman, bypassing crafts such as metalwork or
                  ceramics or carpet weaving. Can there be such a thing as “Arts
                  and Crafts” painting?
                </p>
                <p>
                  This article will address that question by interrogating the
                  relationship between Arts and Crafts design and Pre-Raphaelite
                  painting. In most popular accounts, William Morris and Edward
                  Burne-Jones occupy dual positions; they are both the “second
                  generation” Pre-Raphaelites and guiding forces in the Arts and
                  Crafts movement.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>&nbsp;And yet William Morris merited only a single entry—for an
                  oil painting—in the catalogue for the Tate Gallery’s
                  groundbreaking exhibition <em>The Pre-Raphaelites</em> from
                  1984.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>&nbsp;On the other hand, the Pre-Raphaelites were a mere prologue
                  to Morris’s heroic work as a designer in the Victoria and
                  Albert Museum’s exhibition <em>William Morris</em> from
                  1996.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>&nbsp;This divide between “fine” art and “decorative” art says
                  more about ways in which museums classify objects than about
                  the interconnectedness of the Pre-Raphaelites and the Arts and
                  Crafts movement.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>&nbsp;The recent exhibition
                  <em>Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde</em> (Tate Britain;
                  12 September 2012 to 13 January 2013) broke new ground by
                  displaying a more expansive view; indeed, when the exhibition
                  travelled to the National Gallery in Washington, DC, it was
                  titled <em>Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Art and Design</em> (17
                  February–19 May 2013). By re-connecting the personal and
                  artistic links between these two movements, the exhibition
                  articulated the ways in which painting and design shared
                  concerns with craft, narrative, and ornament.

                  <em>Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde</em> explored the
                  interplay of art and design from the establishment of the
                  Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848 into the 1890s. I would
                  like to further this investigation by interrogating the points
                  of connection between Pre-Raphaelite painting and the Arts and
                  Crafts object. The dynamic interaction between painting and
                  design has long been considered a hallmark of early
                  twentieth-century avant-gardes such as Russian Constructivism
                  and De Stijl. In the latter example, both the abstract art of
                  <a href="#http-www-artic-edu-aic-collections-artwork-109819" target="_blank">Piet Mondrian</a>
                  and the furniture design of
                  <a href="#http-www-moma-org-collection-object-php-object-id-4044" target="_blank">Gerrit Rietveld</a>
                  sought to articulate a utopian vision of a new society.
                  According to art historian Nancy Troy, these artists held “a
                  common set of ethical and aesthetic principles” and explored
                  “the possibility of merging the arts” through “collaborative
                  relationships” over a period of some fifteen years
                  (1917–32).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>&nbsp;The example presented by the “merging”, to borrow Troy’s
                  formulation, of Pre-Raphaelitism and the Arts and Crafts
                  movement is earlier and more complex, if equally utopian. Her
                  terms could describe the creative dynamic between Ford Madox
                  Brown’s <em>Work</em> (1852–65;

                  Both examples declare a commitment to craft. While
                  <em>Work</em> explores the various types of productive and
                  unproductive labour, the unadorned yet elegantly solid form of
                  the washstand celebrates construction. Yet, as I will discuss,
                  Pre-Raphaelite painting was also critical to the later
                  development of the “Arts and Crafts”, closer to the time that
                  T. J. Cobden-Sanderson coined the term in 1887. Crane’s
                  “Craftsman’s Dream” presents painting as both wall decoration
                  and revolutionary agent. The frame of the painting encountered
                  in the museum likewise forms the frame of his dream of a
                  socialist utopia. Taking my cue from William Morris’s
                  reflection on the “English Pre-Raphaelite School” from 1891, I
                  will examine the interplay between painting and design in both
                  Pre-Raphaelite painting and the Arts and Crafts movement. I
                  will address the way in which paintings depicted decorative
                  art, and the way in which decorative art aspired to the
                  symbolic potential traditionally associated with painting. It
                  is my contention that Pre-Raphaelite painting unleashed a
                  radical possibility for decorative art: the Arts and Crafts
                  belief in the political agency of things.

                  “The English Pre-Raphaelite School”
                </h1>
                <p>
                  William Morris reflected on the influence of the “English
                  Pre-Raphaelite School” on 2 October 1891 at the Birmingham
                  Museum and Art Gallery.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>&nbsp;Looking back upon the artistic events of 1848, Morris
                  suggested that the Pre-Raphaelites “revolted” against the art
                  establishment in three ways: through the “presentation of
                  nature”, “the telling of a story”, and “the ornamental
                  function of art”. He then reviews the importance of each of
                  these categories. One would expect, given Morris’s interest in
                  the decorative arts, that he would focus on the final
                  category, the way in which Pre-Raphaelite painting re-imagined
                  the “ornamental function of art”. Yet this “decorative side of
                  the school” is inseparable from its commitment to realism and
                  its interest in narrative, and Morris traces all of these
                  categories back to the Pre-Raphaelite presentation of things.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pre-Raphaelite realism resides in what Morris terms the
                  “presentment of natural facts”. In other words, viewers of
                  Pre-Raphaelite paintings say to themselves, “Here are such and
                  such things as we have seen them, as we see them every day,
                  exceedingly like the things in question.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>&nbsp;For Morris, this mode of presentation constitutes the
                  democratic impulse of Pre-Raphaelitism: its art is addressed
                  to the public rather than to the art establishment, and
                  meaning is built up through the assemblage of recognizable
                  things. At the same time, it underscores the important role of
                  what we might call “accessories” or even “decorative art”
                  within the paintings themselves: the meaning resides in the
                  interpretation of things. This process is not unlike what
                  Erwin Panofsky called the “transfigured reality” of Early
                  Netherlandish painting in his monumental study from 1953.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>&nbsp;He argues that “symbolism and realism permeate one another
                  fully”; to give just a few examples, the single lit candle in
                  the chandelier that hangs over the couple in the
                  <a href="#http-www-nationalgallery-org-uk-paintings-jan-van-eyck-the-arnolfini-portrait" target="_blank"><em>Arnolfini Portrait</em></a>
                  (1434) by Jan van Eyck represents the eye of God, while the
                  dog represents fidelity, and the oranges on the windowsill
                  communicate purity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>&nbsp;The Pre-Raphaelites admired the Northern Renaissance
                  painters like Van Eyck, and the <em>Arnolfini Portrait</em>,
                  in the collection of the National Gallery since 1842, exerted
                  a wide influence on their art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>&nbsp;As George Landow has demonstrated, the Pre-Raphaelite
                  interest in narrative and iconography constituted a kind of
                  “typological symbolism”, the co-mingling of the material world
                  and spiritual meaning.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Morris’s emphasis on “things” in his discussion, and the
                  ability of the viewer to recognize “things as we have seen
                  them”, brings to mind the development of “thing theory” in
                  literary studies.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>&nbsp;Yet in this theoretical formulation, the thing is designated
                  as such because it is <em>unrecognizable</em>. According to
                  Bill Brown, to designate an object a “thing” is to separate it
                  from the world of objects, to suggest that it lies “beyond the
                  grid of intelligibility the way mere things lie outside the
                  grid of museal exhibition”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>&nbsp;Brown here contrasts the inchoate status of the “thing” to
                  the orderly classification of objects in museums. The
                  organization of, for example, keys, or masks, or charms
                  against the evil eye at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford
                  transforms things into objects. But what about the
                  organization of paintings in a museum such as the National
                  Gallery? As John Plotz has pointed out, thing theory “is not a
                  theory about the cultural significance of objects”, one of the
                  key functions of museal exhibition.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup>&nbsp;Rather, thing theory identifies the “limit cases at which
                  our ordinary categories for classifying signs and substances,
                  meaning and materiality, appear to break down”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">22</a></sup>&nbsp;Objects depicted in paintings, what we might called “painted
                  objects”, present an interesting inversion of this logic. In
                  these terms, the painted object is always a thing, since its
                  status as representation means that it is unintelligible as an
                  object. And yet the very fact of this representation restores
                  the thing to the “museal”. Morris praises the “things” in
                  Pre-Raphaelite painting (“here are such and such things”) in a
                  way that suggests he would be familiar with this paradox: the
                  viewer recognizes the specific qualities of a quotidian
                  object—its shape, colour, surface—only through its
                  representation in painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In some discussions of the Arts and Crafts movement, the thing
                  itself is irrelevant. In his consideration of C. R. Ashbee,
                  Alan Crawford declared that “the object is not the
                  object.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">23</a></sup>&nbsp;To put it another way, Ashbee’s own Arts and Crafts
                  enterprise, the Guild of Handicraft, extended Ruskin’s
                  understanding of creative labour to its logical conclusion:
                  the experience of the craftsman should guide any creative
                  enterprise. In a sense, the actual outcome of that enterprise
                  is beside the point. In her recent study
                  <em>Arts and Crafts Objects</em>, Imogen Hart suggested that
                  the objects of the movement cannot be reduced to crafts alone.
                  Carpets, tapestries, wallpapers, and the like offer multiple
                  stories of what it means to be an “Arts and Crafts object”.
                  For example, William Morris’s magnificent “Peacock and Bird”
                  carpet (1885–90; <a href="#moneill-fig5">fig. 5</a>)
                  communicates its meaning through its making.

                  The carpet is a beautiful and useful thing that also expresses
                  the ideals of handicraft, fitness of purpose, and the
                  sensitive use of materials in a design that looked to nature
                  and the artistic past for inspiration. To be “Arts and
                  Crafts”, then, is to exhibit a mode of making, to portray a
                  type of decoration, and to re-imagine what an object can be.
                  As she asserts, “encouraging people to look at decorative art
                  in new ways is one of the most important Arts and Crafts
                  ‘objects’.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">24</a></sup>&nbsp;This dynamic between viewer and thing, between subject and
                  object, underpins Morris’s musing on the Pre-Raphaelites as
                  well as Brown’s theorization of the thing. According to Brown,
                  “the story of objects asserting themselves as things, then, is
                  the story of a changed relationship to the human subject and
                  thus the story of how the thing really names less an object
                  than a particular subject-object relation.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">25</a></sup>&nbsp;For Morris, Pre-Raphaelite naturalism and narrative was
                  inseparable from decoration. Specifically, Pre-Raphaelite
                  paintings modelled a particular kind of subject–object
                  relation which we could call decoration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The attention to decoration links the Pre-Raphaelites and the
                  Arts and Crafts movement in conceptual terms. When we think of
                  “decoration” in terms of the Arts and Crafts, we usually think
                  of objects that fall under the category “decorative art”, such
                  as the “Peacock and Bird” carpet: a commodity likely intended
                  for a domestic setting, its design and fabrication reflects
                  both aesthetic and functional considerations. Victorian
                  artists and critics, however, had a more expansive
                  understanding of the term. Take, for example, William Morris’s
                  definition of Pre-Raphaelite painting. While artistic
                  naturalism goes hand in hand with its ability to tell a story,
                  these two qualities are subsumed under the category of
                  decoration. For Morris, painters such as Dante Gabriel
                  Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones present “things” in a way that
                  also acknowledges the painting itself as a kind of thing, an
                  example itself of decoration: “it ought to be possible for it
                  [a painting] to be part of a beautiful whole in a room or
                  church or hall.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">26</a></sup>&nbsp;For these reasons, Pre-Raphaelite painting suggested a mode
                  of engagement with things—with furniture and decorative art
                  and with the very idea of decoration—that was critical to the
                  Arts and Crafts movement. Pre-Raphaelite paintings reveal the
                  potential of objects to have meaning by rendering them as
                  things. The Arts and Crafts movement then returned these
                  things to the world of objects.

                  The Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society introduced the term
                  “Arts and Crafts” to the public in 1888, the year before Crane
                  wrote “The Craftsman’s Dream”, with an exhibition at the New
                  Gallery in London. A loose confederation of designers and
                  craftsmen had banded together in 1887 to draw attention to
                  their work in order to, in the words of their first president
                  Crane, “give opportunity to the designer and craftsman to
                  exhibit their work to the public for its artistic interest and
                  thus to assert the claims of decorative art and handicraft to
                  attention equally with the painter of easel pictures”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">27</a></sup>&nbsp;Here Crane signals a number of the innovations we now
                  associate with the movement: a dual emphasis on the
                  intellectual practice of design as well as the maker’s skill,
                  the desire for a greater public appreciation of these
                  interlinked processes, and recognition that “decorative arts”
                  were as worthy of public exhibition and attention as the fine
                  art of painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artists such as Crane found inspiration in the collaborative
                  projects undertaken by William Morris and the design work he
                  pioneered with Burne-Jones, Rossetti, and Ford Madox Brown in
                  the preceding decades. The moment when Morris and Burne-Jones
                  met Rossetti constituted what many have called a “second
                  phase” of Pre-Raphaelitism in the 1850s, one in which
                  decorative practices like mural painting came to the fore.
                  When Rossetti invited Morris and Burne-Jones and others to
                  join him in creating frescoes for the new
                  <a href="#https-www-oxford-union-org-library-murals" target="_blank">debating hall of the Oxford Union</a>, he shifted Pre-Raphaelitism from easel painting into
                  decorative practice. As I will discuss, this interest in mural
                  painting as a mode of wall covering became a central aspect of
                  the Arts and Crafts movement, even though opportunities to
                  realize this ideal were few.

                <p>
                  Painting also became a part of furniture design, as in “The
                  Prioress’s Tale Wardrobe” (1857–8;
                  <a href="#moneill-fig6">fig. 6</a>), planned as a wedding
                  present from Burne-Jones to Morris. The wardrobe exemplifies
                  the junction between Pre-Raphaelite painting and Arts and
                  Crafts design. This type of “decorative painting”, as it was
                  known, was a regular feature of the movement. Such
                  hand-crafted decoration resisted the cheap, mass-produced
                  ethos of the marketplace even as it addressed the
                  functionality of the wardrobe: in this instance, the jamb
                  between the two doors divides heaven from earth in relating a
                  story from Geoffrey Chaucer’s <em>Canterbury Tales</em>. A
                  further division in the lower portion divides narrative
                  (Chaucer writing his story) from narration (a portion of the
                  text in painted form). A few years later, the establishment of
                  Morris’s firm of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co. in 1861
                  broadened the audience for this type of thoughtful integration
                  of art and craft.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A Pre-Raphaelite exploration of historical forms of art and
                  the admiration of nature also guided the pattern designs
                  produced by “the Firm” and by its later incarnation, Morris
                  &amp; Co., established in 1875. As Diane Waggoner has
                  discussed, Morris’s “Cray” (1884;
                  <a href="#moneill-fig7">fig. 7</a>) blended contemporary
                  Indian textiles and historic examples with an organic
                  structure rooted in his deep affinity for the natural
                  world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">28</a></sup>&nbsp;The rounded meandering lines evoke but do not delineate the
                  abundant banks of the Cray, a tributary of the Thames.
                  Morris’s philosophy of a lively pattern design rooted in and
                  yet abstracted from nature exerted a profound impact on the
                  next generation, including Walter Crane, as suggested by his
                  “Teazle” wallpaper design for Jeffrey &amp; Co. from 1894 (<a href="#moneill-fig8">fig. 8</a>). Crane borrowed the curving forms of Morris’s diagonal
                  lines to structure his own pattern while eschewing the dense
                  floral background considered more appropriate for textiles
                  than for wallpaper. This attention to nature, combined with an
                  admiration for the expressive forms of historical art, brings
                  the concerns of Pre-Raphaelite painting into the realm of
                  pattern design. “Cray” also evokes interest in older, often
                  labour-intensive forms of artistic practice. Morris revived a
                  method of cloth printing known as the “indigo-discharge”, and
                  this pattern required no less than thirty-four printing blocks
                  to achieve its lively and vivid design.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">29</a></sup>&nbsp;“Cray” presents a design analogue to the Pre-Raphaelite
                  attention to the craft of painting; the layering of the
                  printing is here akin to the layering of paint on canvas, both
                  beginning with the white ground that characterized the
                  Pre-Raphaelite approach to painting.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">30</a></sup>&nbsp;The crafting of a Pre-Raphaelite canvas conceptualized an
                  approach to artistic process that would become central to the
                  Arts and Crafts movement.

                  The displays of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society brought
                  these paradigms to public attention.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">31</a></sup>&nbsp;We can see how these strands came together with the
                  presentation of Crane’s wallpaper design entitled “The Golden
                  Age” (1886) at the inaugural 1888 exhibition. It was featured
                  in a section of the display devoted to the wares of the
                  wallpaper manufacturer Jeffrey &amp; Co., whose director
                  Metford Warner appreciated the expressive potential of design.
                  As such, “The Golden Age” appeared in four different
                  treatments: one sample of embossed leather with the design
                  hand-painted by Crane (<a href="#moneill-fig9">fig. 9</a>) and
                  a second sample made of embossed paste-board that simulated
                  leather (<a href="#moneill-fig10">fig. 10</a>), again with the
                  design hand-painted by Crane. The exhibition also featured a
                  hammered metal plate with the same pattern designed by Crane
                  but executed this time by Thomas Godfrey, a skilled
                  metalworker. The final iteration was not a manufacturer’s
                  sample: Crane’s showed his original watercolour design for the
                  paper (<a href="#moneill-fig11">fig. 11</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">32</a></sup>&nbsp;While it was typical for a design to be available in a
                  variety of treatments for different types of markets, in its
                  various permutations “The Golden Age” also suggested the
                  inventiveness of the designer and his collaboration with other
                  makers. In addition, Crane’s design acknowledged the
                  individual agency of the consumer in selecting a treatment, as
                  it was also available in two colourways, red and blue (<a href="#moneill-fig13">figs. 13</a>
                  and <a href="#moneill-fig14">14</a>) as a wood-block printed
                  wallpaper.

                  If the museum presented the golden ages of the past for
                  Crane’s wandering craftsman in “The Craftsman’s Dream”, then
                  the Arts and Crafts display illustrated the golden age of the
                  present. But the two were in dynamic contact: Crane found
                  inspiration for his design of stylized putti holding aloft a
                  basket of ripe fruit crowned by a pineapple in historical
                  examples, such an embossed leather panels from the seventeenth
                  century, like those still extant at
                  <a href="#https-nttreasurehunt-files-wordpress-com-2010-07-ntpl-96498-jpg" target="_blank">Dyrham Park in Gloucestershire</a>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">33</a></sup>&nbsp;Crane’s four samples of “The Golden Age” ally a
                  Pre-Raphaelite evocation of an artistic past to the goals of
                  the Arts and Crafts movement. In this, he and others drew
                  inspiration from the imaginative and self-conscious
                  reconstruction of a past that never existed—an imagined
                  “golden age” of art also evoked by objects such as “The
                  Prioress’s Tale Wardrobe”. Yet these concerns with decoration
                  and meaning predate the collaborative venture launched by
                  Morris in the late 1850s; in fact, they reach all the way back
                  to the first examples of Pre-Raphaelite painting and the
                  depiction of decoration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Take, for example, John Everett Millais’s
                  <em>Isabella</em> (1848–9;
                  <a href="#moneill-fig14">fig. 14</a>), one of the “manifesto”
                  paintings shown at the Royal Academy in 1849 and signed with
                  the initials PRB. If we focus on the decorative objects in the
                  painting, we find that they communicate the narrative of
                  forbidden love and family violence that will end with the
                  murder of Lorenzo at the hands of Isabella’s brothers, a
                  post-mortem beheading, and the planting of his head in a pot
                  of basil. For example, Isabella dines on a majolica plate that
                  depicts a beheading scene (<a href="#moneill-fig15">fig. 15</a>). It is likely a scene of Hercules beheading the Hydra,
                  similar to one now in the collection of the Ashmolean Museum,
                  Oxford (<a href="#moneill-fig16">fig. 16</a>). As Elizabeth
                  Prettejohn has pointed out, “the setting and accessory details
                  are literally ‘Pre-Raphaelite,’ Italian examples from the time
                  before Raphael.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">34</a></sup>&nbsp;Yet they are more than just historically appropriate props;
                  their detailed description demands that the viewer look, and
                  look again, to puzzle over their form and significance in the
                  same way that decoration and description are integrated in
                  “The Prioress’s Tale Wardrobe”. In Bill Brown’s terms, these
                  objects become things, and both engender what Tim Barringer
                  has called one of the central “paradoxes” of Pre-Raphaelite
                  painting: an insistence on the contemporary that also asserts
                  the historical.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">35</a></sup>

                <p>
                  The new “Pre-Raphaelite” way of painting pioneered by Millais
                  and his fellow travellers furthered this paradox: the emphasis
                  on line in the delineation of forms, and the use of bright,
                  unmixed colours creates a visual effect not unlike a pattern.
                  Without the traditional use of light and shade, the pictorial
                  space is daringly uniform, always threatening to collapse into
                  flatness.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">36</a></sup>&nbsp;Both Walter Crane and Ford Madox Brown would later describe
                  this treatment of space as decorative. In a lecture on
                  “Decorative Painting” to the Arts and Crafts Exhibition
                  Society in 1888, Crane explained that “the first essential of
                  a decoration is that it shall be related to its environment,
                  that it shall express or acknowledge the conditions under
                  which it exists.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">37</a></sup>&nbsp;If it is a painting, then it should acknowledge the
                  two-dimensionality of its support. Ford Madox Brown reiterated
                  this point with characteristic candour when he lectured on
                  painting at the 1889 exhibition: “the very essence of the
                  wall-picture is its solidity, or at least, its not appearing
                  to be a hole in the wall.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">38</a></sup>&nbsp;This flatness keeps our eye on the surface, returning again
                  and again to the things and faces outlined against that golden
                  backdrop.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The repeating pattern of Millais’s wall covering is an example
                  of good design; it, at least, acknowledges the flatness of the
                  surface—and this is another aspect of its contemporaneity. In
                  fact, it resembles wallpaper designs from the 1840s by A. W.
                  N. Pugin, one of the first pattern designers to declare that
                  ornament should “enrich” the construction of the surface
                  rather than disguise it.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">39</a></sup>&nbsp;For a Gothic Revivalist such as Pugin, this meant studying
                  the principles that governed a pattern and adapting that to a
                  modern design such as his “Rose and Lion” wallpaper from about
                  1848 (<a href="#moneill-fig17">fig. 17</a>). To garner motifs
                  and patterning for his designs, ecclesiastical and secular
                  alike, Pugin studied historical examples of Italian woven
                  silks from around 1500 (<a href="#moneill-fig18">fig. 18</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">40</a></sup>&nbsp;These same fabrics were often depicted as the “cloths of
                  honour” that cover the throne of the Virgin Mary in Early
                  Renaissance panel paintings in gold and tempera, as in
                  <a href="#http-www-nationalgallery-org-uk-paintings-gentile-da-fabriano-the-quaratesi-madonna" target="_blank">Gentile da Fabriano’s <em>Quaratesi Altarpiece</em></a>, and this selection by Millais perhaps emphasizes the pure
                  and sacred love that Lorenzo and Isabella share.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">41</a></sup>&nbsp;The artist repeats this decorative scheme to different
                  narrative ends a few years later with his
                  <em>Mariana</em> (1850–1;
                  <a href="#moneill-fig19">fig. 19</a>). In this narrative of
                  sexual frustration, the flora and fauna of the golden wall
                  covering seem to taunt Mariana in their fecundity. And yet
                  they also present a contrast to the vivid description of
                  nature that lies outside her window. By placing these two
                  “side by side”, as it were, Millais emphasizes not only the
                  flatness of the decorative wall covering but also its
                  potential for symbolic narrative. Millais’s chosen wall
                  coverings, then, are both strikingly modern and historically
                  precise in each instance.

                  Crane would explore this type of decoration in his practice as
                  a painter, as in his depiction in 1872 of his wife reading,
                  <em>At Home: A Portrait</em> (<a href="#moneill-fig20">fig. 20</a>). Crane recalled in his autobiography that his first-hand
                  encounter with Millais’s paintings at the Royal Academy
                  exhibition of 1857, when Crane was only twelve years old,
                  “impressed me beyond words”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">42</a></sup>&nbsp;In emulation of the Pre-Raphaelites, he adopted a
                  consciously archaizing painting style, using tempera here as
                  his medium. Mary Frances Crane, the artist’s wife, leans on a
                  mantelpiece, her arm gently resting beside an Italian-style
                  vase labelled “Maria”. The interior is artfully composed, and
                  every surface appears decorated or designed, from the quilting
                  of her costume to the gold-embroidered saddle blanket in the
                  hunting scene on the wall. In the study for the work (ca.
                  1870; <a href="#moneill-fig21">fig. 21</a>), Crane sketched
                  his wife posing in front of a green wall, beside a chair
                  nearby that resembles the
                  <a href="#http-www-ngv-vic-gov-au-explore-collection-work-20700" target="_blank">“Sussex” side chair by Morris &amp; Co.</a>
                  He later revised the design to include a decorative
                  background, a tapestry abounding in narrative detail.

                  The decoration enriches the painting’s evocation of domestic
                  life. The story is hunting in romantic and spiritual terms
                  related through an amalgam of pagan and Christian symbolism.
                  Just above Crane’s wife’s head, a rider carries a staff with a
                  banner labelled “St. Hubert”, the patron saint of the hunt who
                  was converted to Christianity by a vision of the Crucifixion
                  between the horns of a stag. A doppelgänger for Mrs Crane
                  appears in the decorative background as a Renaissance princess
                  wearing split sleeves and a white lace collar, coiffure
                  adorned with the half-moon crown of the goddess Diana as Queen
                  of the Hunt. Below the huntress, the fox’s head points towards
                  a motto from Virgil that refers to Diana’s famed hunting
                  ground in Sparta. Above the huntress, Cupid takes aim while a
                  crane flies overhead. The disparate elements of this pictorial
                  background coalesce in a fascinating evocation of the Cranes’
                  life together, as the artist blends religious tradition,
                  classical mythology, and ancient literature to explain how
                  this huntress captured him. In the manner of tapestry
                  decorations undertaken at the same time by Morris &amp; Co.,
                  the full narrative potential of the image emerges only in the
                  decorative background, a powerful comment upon the power of
                  the object, or the image, in this instance, to conjure
                  alternate worlds.

                  The symbolic potential of decoration, gleaned from the
                  Pre-Raphaelites, also informed Crane’s work as a book
                  illustrator. Decorative art abounds in his illustrations for
                  <em>Jack and the Beanstalk</em>, <em>The Frog Prince</em>, and
                  <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> created throughout the 1870s.
                  Yet these things all contribute to the narratives of the
                  stories. In <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, for example, the
                  internal emotional progress of Beauty is shown through the
                  decoration. In one illustration, she stands in front of a wall
                  painting that depicts the Garden of Eden, where human and
                  beast coexist peacefully, near a female nude who is a dual
                  image of Venus and Eve, foreshadowing the developing romance
                  between Beauty and the Beast (<a href="#moneill-fig22">fig. 22</a>). A later critic argued that Crane’s illustrations realized
                  the relationship of part to whole, depicting “the equal
                  importance of what are generally regarded as accessories”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">43</a></sup>&nbsp;Crane himself claimed that illustrations were essential in
                  children’s books as “the eye” is “the chief organ for the
                  reception of ideas”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">44</a></sup>&nbsp;The latter rely upon emblems to communicate narrative and
                  trust in the ability of the viewer or reader to translate the
                  message from fantasy into reality. Throughout the second half
                  of the nineteenth century, early childhood educators
                  emphasized the role of symbolism in pedagogy and the
                  accompanying need to teach children how to interpret
                  non-verbal signs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">45</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the same way, paintings such as
                  <em>At Home: A Portrait</em> and Crane’s book illustrations
                  are premised on the idea that the decoration can be read and
                  interpreted. But what happens when we remove the framing
                  device of the painting or the page? What does the decorative
                  wall communicate in the real world, rather than the realm of
                  art? William Morris discussed the symbolic potential of
                  decoration in his lecture “Some Hints on Pattern-Designing”
                  from 1881. He declared that all decoration is “futile” and
                  “degraded” unless it reminds the viewer of “something beyond
                  itself, of something of which it is a visible symbol”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">46</a></sup>&nbsp;However, he suggested that natural forms were the most
                  appropriate inspiration for such work. In this regard, Crane’s
                  wallpaper is a symbolic design that more closely resembles
                  paintings by Millais than patterns of Morris. Decorative
                  design such as Crane’s “Golden Age” depends upon a broad
                  visual language, a kind of alphabet of forms, to communicate
                  meaning.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">47</a></sup>&nbsp;The art historian Ernst Gombrich warned against the
                  “multiplicity of meaning” inherent in the study of
                  symbols.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">48</a></sup>&nbsp;And he suggested that the decorative in particular was not a
                  successful symbolic mode, wondering “where does meaning end
                  and the decorative pattern begin?”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">49</a></sup>&nbsp;Perhaps for this reason, most pattern designs by Morris
                  resist narration: it is beside the point to ask what “Cray”
                  means. In his lecture, Morris noted that such designs are
                  “suggestive” rather than “imitative”. For this and other
                  reasons, it doesn’t tell “facts”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">50</a></sup>&nbsp;It expresses its ideals through its pattern.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For Crane, however, the pattern is narrative. In “The
                  Craftsman’s Dream”, a visit to the museum prompts a meditation
                  on the golden ages of the past and a dream of their future
                  realization. With “The Golden Age”, the design reframes the
                  question of temporality in terms of the ages of humankind:
                  when was “the golden age” and will it be again? Here the
                  design figures the very negotiation of past, present, and the
                  future inherent in this process: one putto looks towards the
                  basket, the promise of the golden age. Yet the other looks
                  away, out towards the viewer, or perhaps into the room that
                  the wallpaper adorned. One cockatoo approaches the basket,
                  while another looks up, leading the eye to follow the repeat
                  of the pattern to the next set of putti.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">51</a></sup>&nbsp;As the pattern travels up and over, across the wall, it
                  acknowledges the space that it adorns, and it asks the
                  inhabitant of that space to reflect upon the past in the
                  present moment, as well as to contemplate the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “The Golden Age” is, to paraphrase John Ruskin, an object that
                  can be read “rightly” in terms of pictorial narrative. Ruskin
                  formulated this idea in response to William Holman Hunt’s
                  <em>The Awakening Conscience</em> (1853–4;
                  <a href="#moneill-fig23">fig. 23</a>), a painting whose
                  complex iconography of sin and redemption had confused some
                  contemporary critics and offended others. In a letter to the
                  <em>Times</em>, Ruskin explained that the key to understanding
                  the painting was to allow “trivial objects” such as the
                  discarded glove, or the veneer of the piano, to “force
                  themselves upon the attention” with an insistence that does
                  not allow the viewer to look away.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">52</a></sup>&nbsp;Likewise, the art critic F. G. Stephens, a member of the
                  Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, noted that here “the very
                  decorations on the wall are significant.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53">53</a></sup>

                  This significance functions in two ways: the wallpaper is a
                  gaudy and overwrought example of bad design, a further marker
                  of the room’s immorality. No overarching principle of pattern
                  unites the birds, vines, grapes, sleeping child, and sheaves
                  of wheat (<a href="#moneill-fig24">fig. 24</a>). Furthermore,
                  the floral border disguises the corner of the room and thus
                  disrupts the surface of the wall (perhaps for this reason it
                  is sometimes suggested that this is a tapestry, and not
                  wallpaper). At the same time, a perceptive critic like
                  Stephens noted that the wallpaper encapsulated the story of
                  the painting: “a vineyard, in which corn is mingled with the
                  vine; birds destroy the grapes of the latter, while at the
                  foot sleeps a boy-guardian, whose horn, fallen from his hand,
                  indicates neglected duty”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54">54</a></sup>&nbsp;I do not want to suggest that this type of symbolic
                  decoration was a new feature of painting; the art historian
                  George Landow, for example, pointed to Holman Hunt’s
                  admiration for William Hogarth and his “modern moral
                  pictures”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55">55</a></sup>&nbsp;Rather, it provided an important model for artists of
                  Crane’s generation. Morris’s “Peacock and Bird” carpet was one
                  response to the cheap machine-made goods catalogued in Holman
                  Hunt’s painting, yet it resists any attempt to interpret it in
                  the way that Stephens can interpret Holman Hunt’s rendering of
                  wallpaper. With “The Golden Age”, in contrast, it is as if
                  Crane has extracted the decorative background from a
                  Pre-Raphaelite painting but maintained its symbolic power.

                  A “Golden Age” of things
                </h1>
                <p>
                  Crane, a committed socialist since 1884, would have been aware
                  of the political import of the notion of a “Golden Age”. It
                  became a trope in socialist and anarchist discourse to
                  re-direct the longing for an idealized past into a future
                  hope, usually expressed as the dictum, “the Golden Age lies in
                  the future, not in the past.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56">56</a></sup>&nbsp;We find this “golden age” in Crane’s political cartoons,
                  designs such as “The Triumph of Labour” from 1891 (<a href="#moneill-fig25">fig. 25</a>), a scene brimming with natural vivacity—the abundance
                  promised by the fruit of “The Golden Age” is here
                  realized.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57">57</a></sup>&nbsp;Morris made only a few designs for the socialist cause and
                  employed a visual language of natural forms familiar from his
                  wallpaper designs, as in his membership card for the
                  Democratic Federation (<a href="#moneill-fig26">fig. 26</a>).
                  Crane’s works, in contrast, combined the human figure and
                  natural forms to convey their message. It was Crane who
                  created the visual culture of English socialism: he even
                  designed the punning emblem for Morris’s own Hammersmith
                  branch of the Socialist League: Morris is the smith who quite
                  literally forges the instruments of a new society (<a href="#moneill-fig27">fig. 27</a>). The design would later be adapted to
                  <a href="#http-janeymorris-blogspot-com-2012-06-hammersmith-socialist-society-including-html" target="_blank">Morris’s Hammersmith Socialist Society</a>. Other designs often depicted a utopia not unlike the
                  “Nowhere” found in Morris’s novel
                  <em>News from Nowhere</em> of 1890. The cover of Morris’s
                  socialist newspaper, <em>Commonweal</em>, from 24 May 1890,
                  elegantly juxtaposes Crane’s vision with that of Morris: in
                  the centre of the serialization of <em>News from Nowhere</em>,
                  now at the chapter describing revolution entitled “How the
                  Change Came”, we find Crane’s vision of that change: a cartoon
                  declaring the international “Solidarity of Labour” depicting
                  the united workers of the world (<a href="#moneill-fig28">fig. 28</a>). Hand in hand, they encircle the globe. Reproduced in
                  newspapers and given away at rallies, these cartoons do not
                  have recourse to the usual arsenal of satire, parody, and
                  caricature, or even Morris’s own allusions to revolutionary
                  violence in his explanation of “how the change came” in
                  <em>News from Nowhere</em>. Rather, they gain their power
                  through their very idealism, the portrayal of a coming golden
                  age, rendered in a decorative style familiar from Crane’s
                  wallpapers.

                  These designs further confused the category “decoration” at
                  the very moment when others sought to fix these terms. Morris,
                  for example, excluded easel painting from the decorative arts
                  in a lecture from 1877, since most canvases were “ingenious
                  toys for a few rich and idle men” that were “at the present
                  day divorced from decoration”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58">58</a></sup>&nbsp;In this regard, we must distinguish between Morris’s own
                  views and the programme put forth by the Arts and Crafts
                  Exhibition Society. The establishment of the Society derived
                  in equal measure from Morris’s championing of the decorative
                  arts <em>and</em> from the powerful critique of the Royal
                  Academy, first expressed by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in
                  1848 and re-stated in 1886 by Crane, along with William Holman
                  Hunt and the painter George Clausen. They wrote an open letter
                  to the Academy lambasting its restrictive exhibition
                  practices. In its place, they proposed a truly national
                  exhibition that would bring together the work of artists,
                  designers, and craftsmen. Crucially, this agitation did not
                  exclude painters.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59">59</a></sup>&nbsp;Instead, they argued that painting was a decorative art with
                  its own discourse of use and materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This activism resulted in the creation of the Arts and Crafts
                  Exhibition Society, and Holman Hunt and Ford Madox Brown both
                  joined. These exhibitions regularly featured designs and
                  cartoons for mural painting—a historic mode of wall covering
                  that could be narrative and decorative, like tapestry or
                  wallpaper. Crane, Edward Burne-Jones, Frederic Leighton, and
                  George Frederick Watts all showed cartoons at these displays,
                  and the few photographs that have survived, taken by Emery
                  Walker, show the diversity of items on display as well as the
                  surprising fact that the majority of display space is given
                  over to wall coverings (<a href="#moneill-fig29">fig. 29</a>).
                  The acknowledged master of this decorative art was Ford Madox
                  Brown, who created twelve murals depicting the history of
                  Manchester for
                  <a href="#http-www-manchester-gov-uk-townhall-info-8-about-the-town-hall-19-the-town-hall-murals-by-ford-madox-brown" target="_blank">Manchester Town Hall</a>, executed from 1877 to 1893. For Crane, these were the most
                  important examples of public painting in England—moving beyond
                  the boundaries of the picture frame to address a broader
                  public. They signalled a return to the ideal of the integrated
                  artistic practice, when “painting was once what it might be
                  again . . . at the head of the decorative arts.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60">60</a></sup>&nbsp;As I have argued, we can trace this logic back to the
                  Pre-Raphaelites.

                  Intriguingly, a letter from William Holman Hunt to the Arts
                  and Crafts organizing committee in 1889 asked “whether framed
                  pictures were or were not admissible to the exhibition”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61">61</a></sup>&nbsp;The minutes note that the question was left undecided. But
                  at least one oil painting did feature in an exhibition: the
                  second, smaller version of Ford Madox Brown’s
                  <em>Work</em> from 1863 (Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery;
                  <a href="#moneill-fig30">fig. 30</a>), which served as the
                  centrepiece for a memorial retrospective of his decorative
                  designs in 1896. In a sense, this display treated the smaller
                  version as a kind of cartoon for its larger (and earlier)
                  iteration in Manchester.

                  It is intriguing to think of <em>Work</em> as a design that
                  decorates a wall—what Brown called a “wall-picture”—rather
                  than an easel painting. For one, the perspectival recession of
                  space constructed by the brick wall on the left and Heath
                  Street on the right begins to waver, overtaken by a series of
                  horizontal bands marked out by the raised shovels of the
                  navvies. What remains is, in the words of Tim Barringer, a
                  “great secular altarpiece”, with a rich and complex narrative
                  about the redemptive value of work, one that would have
                  resonated with the crafts on display in the adjacent
                  galleries.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn62" id="fnref62">62</a></sup>&nbsp;Given the scale, ambition, and message of <em>Work</em> as a
                  decorative design, it did not seem out of place beside
                  mosaics, stained glass windows, and wallpaper, in addition to
                  Brown’s own designs for furniture. William Morris stated,
                  “Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be
                  useful, or believe to be beautiful.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn63" id="fnref63">63</a></sup>&nbsp;Perhaps Morris’s use of “nothing” should be interrogated
                  further in light of the distinction between thing and object
                  prompted by thing theory. Houses should not have
                  unintelligible and unrecognizable things but instead be filled
                  with objects. The “Peacock and Bird” carpet not only covers
                  the floor but also re-imagines the relationship between
                  producer and consumer. Arts and Crafts objects re-imagined
                  subject–object relations. In this regard, <em>Work</em> is an
                  Arts and Crafts painting, and it represents at least a partial
                  fulfilment of Crane’s dream of the craftsman.

                        acknowledged the importance of the alphabet to design
                        theory: “We know that the letters of our alphabet were
                        once pictures, symbols, or abstract signs of entities
                        and actions, and grew more and more abstract until they
                        became arbitrary marks—the familiar characters that we
                        know.” Crane, <em>Decorative Illustration of Books</em>,

                  The Look First feature represents a different kind of article
                  to its companions in <em>British Art Studies</em>; one that is
                  pre-eminently visual and necessarily collaborative, and that
                  is made possible by the digital format of the journal. In this
                  series of short films made by Jonathan Law, the art historian
                  James Boaden, and the curator of The John Deakin Archive, Paul
                  Rousseau, discuss the double-exposure images made by the
                  photographer John Deakin (1912-1972) in the 1950s and 1960s.
                  The films ask you, firstly, to look closely at the images
                  being discussed. Each one begins with a sustained and intense
                  shot of a single image before opening up to a wide-ranging
                  discussion about Deakin, double exposures, and photography.

                  In this film, John Deakin’s double-exposure images are
                  discussed in relation to a longer history of revealing the
                  unseen in photography. The film begins with Deakin’s double
                  exposure of Muriel Belcher, the founder of the Colony Room,
                  the infamous private club in London’s Soho district that was
                  regularly frequented by artists and musicians such as Francis
                  Bacon and George Melly.&nbsp; Deakin’s images are here discussed in
                  relation to Victorian spirit photography and to a longer
                  history of the doubled image in twentieth-century photography.

                  John Deakin started his career as a dresser of shop windows
                  and his images of windows set the scene for this discussion.
                  The film explores Deakin’s double exposures in relation to the
                  queer cultures of postwar London. Boaden and Rousseau discuss
                  the ways in which the double exposure served as a metaphor for
                  the idea of living a doubled life at a time when homosexuality
                  was illegal. They explore the ambivalent character of such
                  photographs as works that both reveal and conceal, bringing
                  this idea up to the present by discussing the double exposures
                  made by contemporary photographer Daniella Zalcman.

                  This film explores John Deakin’s artistic development from the
                  1930s into the war years, contextualizing his work within a
                  broader framework of 20^th^&nbsp;century Modernism. Presenting new
                  research from the Tate Gallery Archives that connects Deakin
                  to British photographer Barbara Ker-Seymer, it includes the
                  discovery of an early double exposure that could have been
                  taken by either photographer. Paul Rousseau and James Boaden
                  take account of the surrealist elements of the double
                  exposures, exploring connections to Francis Bacon’s&nbsp;*Man in
                  Blue&nbsp;*series; and Jonathan Law presents Deakin’s double
                  exposure portraits alongside a rich seam of others by artists
                  including Degas, Duchamp and Picasso, positioning the
                  time-based multiple planes within these photographs alongside
                  the generation of cubism.

                <p>
                  John Deakin (1912-1972) was a British photographer, best known
                  for a striking series of portraits he took when working for
                  British <em>Vogue</em> magazine in the early 1950s. He moved
                  from being a window dresser to a painter, having a
                  well-regarded exhibition in 1938 at the Mayor Gallery, Cork
                  Street, London. Later, he claimed his skills with a camera
                  were initiated around this time in Paris in the circle of
                  André Ostier, Christian Bérard and Michel de Brunhoff, but he
                  was also close to the photographer Barbara Ker-Seymer in
                  London, and may well have learned something from her
                  experimental portraiture studio practice. During the Second
                  World War he refined his skills in the Army Film and
                  Photographic Unit (AFPU) serving in Malta, Egypt, Libya, and
                  as far south as the Gold Coast, now Ghana. Deakin claimed the
                  war changed him from “a painter who passed himself off as a
                  photographer, to a photographer who sometimes painted”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the war&nbsp;Deakin became a central presence among the
                  hard-drinking bohemian artists, poets, and characters in the
                  bars and clubs around Soho London. This put him among many of
                  the key cultural figures of the period, including the poet
                  Dylan Thomas, the painter Lucian Freud, and especially Francis
                  Bacon. He worked for <em>Tatler</em> and
                  <em>Picture Post</em> and used his Paris connections to win a
                  contract at British <em>Vogue</em>.

                  This article examines the protean nature of
                  <em>ingegno</em> in Renaissance England. Beginning with
                  dictionary definitions and period translations, it traces the
                  semantics of <em>ingegno</em> in writings by Haydocke,
                  Hilliard, Sidney, Harington, and Dee, and in images by
                  Gheeraerts the elder and Hilliard. The term’s semantic
                  elasticity carried over into English, changing shape to denote
                  variously “wit”, “inborn talent”, “sharpness”, “swiftness”,
                  “nobility”, “freedom”, and “ingenuity”. The article concludes
                  by considering the socio-economics of ingenuity, and how the
                  slippage between “ingenious” and “ingenuous” speaks to a newly
                  emerging understanding of the liberal status of the artist and
                  his craft.

                <p>
                  It has long been known that Elizabethan and Jacobean writers
                  had difficulty comprehending, and especially translating, the
                  terms of Italian art criticism. Richard Haydocke’s translation
                  of Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo’s
                  <em>Trattato dell’arte de la pittura, scoltura, et
                    architettura</em>
                  (1584/5)—<em>A tracte containing the artes of curious paintinge,
                    carvinge and buildinge</em>
                  (1598)—is often singled out as a potent example of such
                  difficulties. As Lucy Gent noted pithily, “Where Lomazzo
                  writes about ‘arte disegnatrice’, Haydocke is floored.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;But while the English response to a word/concept such as
                  <em>disegno</em> has attracted considerable scholarly
                  attention, the reception of a key theme in Italian Renaissance
                  writings on the arts—<em>ingegno</em>—has been largely
                  neglected.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;This essay explores the fortunes of <em>ingegno</em> in
                  England, particularly in relation to Haydocke’s influential
                  book and the writings of his acquaintance, the limner Nicholas
                  Hilliard.

                  The semantics of 'ingegno'
                </h1>
                <p>
                  Deriving from the Latin <em>ingenium</em>, <em>ingegno</em> is
                  a term that became semantically inflated over the course of
                  the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries in Italy, in
                  particular in writings about faculty psychology and the
                  arts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>&nbsp;The first dictionary definition in English is John Florio’s
                  in <em>A worlde of wordes</em> (1598), in which the adjective
                  <em>ingegnóso</em> is rendered as “wittie, wilie, ingenious,
                  subtile, wise, cunning, craftie, full of inuention”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>&nbsp;Florio’s <em>ingegno</em> embraces qualities that had
                  started to attach to <em>ingenium</em> over the course of the
                  sixteenth century but which had previously been lexically
                  distinct from it, such as “subtlety” (<em>subtilitas</em>),
                  “cunning” (<em>sollertia</em>), and even “wisdom”
                  (<em>sapientia</em>). Notably, the first translation he gives
                  is “wittie”, reflecting the widespread use in English of “wit”
                  to denote the various properties of <em>ingenium</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>&nbsp;Indeed, this is Haydocke’s most frequent translation of
                  Lomazzo’s <em>ingegno</em>, such as the “excellency of . . .
                  wit” required of the poet, or the “fineness of . . . wit”
                  exhibited by Lomazzo’s master Gaudenzio Ferrari in his
                  painting of <em>cangianti</em> colours.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Wit, <em>ingenium</em>, and <em>ingegno</em> could all mean
                  generically “natural disposition” or the innate talents with
                  which one is born. These talents may be brought to perfection
                  and utility through teaching and diligence, neatly summarized
                  in the popular mottoes <em>ars et ingenium</em> and
                  <em>ingenium et labor</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>&nbsp;Lomazzo invokes this “natural ability” sense of
                  <em>ingegno</em> in the preface to his treatise, where, in a
                  customary apology for deficiency, he writes that by his “debil
                  ingegno” (aptly rendered by Haydocke as “as much as in me
                  lay”), he has gathered together the rules of the “science of
                  painting”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>&nbsp;Yet <em>ingegno</em> could also denote
                  <em>special</em> talent. In particular, when mobilized by or
                  on behalf of artists it could refer to the creative potency
                  necessary to imagine and invent in a way that cannot be
                  taught, and which thus raises the possessor of
                  <em>ingegno</em> above their less gifted peers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Italian and English dictionary definitions capture some of
                  these senses. For example, the
                  <em>Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca</em> (1612)
                  defines <em>ingegno</em> as “Acutezza d’inventare, e
                  ghiribizzare, che che sia, senza maestro, o avvertitore”
                  (“Sharpness in inventing and fantasizing whatsoever, without a
                  teacher or prompter”).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>&nbsp;Lomazzo grants this capacity to the “ingenious painter”, who
                  can “imagine of himself” a variety of postures and
                  expressions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>&nbsp;Crucially, these interpretations place
                  <em>ingegno</em> within the realm of the
                  imagination—especially, in La Crusca’s <em>ghiribizzare</em>,
                  with the caprices of fancy—while distancing it from
                  commonplace associations of <em>ingenium</em> with
                  teachability or models. This implies not only that
                  <em>ingegno</em> is an innate quality but also that it
                  operates without or beyond rules. Moreover, the fact that it
                  needs no prompting connects it to spontaneity and quickness.

                <p>
                  This is one of the key senses we find in Cesare Ripa’s popular
                  handbook of iconography: the <em>Iconologia</em>, in which
                  “<em>Ingegno</em> is that potency of spirit which by nature
                  inclines a man to be quick, able in all the sciences” (<a href="#amarr-fig1">fig. 1</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                  Such a definition reflects period celebrations of visual
                  artists who work in a rapid yet masterful way, underpinning
                  also the increasing value of the sketch—sometimes referred to
                  in Italian as a <em>ghiribizzo</em>—as the direct and
                  immediate manifestation of an artist’s idea.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>&nbsp;In this sense, <em>ingegno</em> was related to
                  <em>disegno</em>, which by the second half of the sixteenth
                  century had become (at least in the hands of academicians such
                  as Giorgio Vasari and Federico Zuccaro) the means of
                  explaining the connection between a metaphysical idea, the
                  artist’s mental creation in his intellectual faculties, and
                  its subsequent manifestation through the skilful workings of
                  the hand.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite the evident confusion about <em>disegno</em> in
                  England around 1600, something of this kind is at work in Sir
                  John Harington’s anecdote about Nicholas Hilliard (see
                  <a href="#amarr-fig2">fig. 2</a>), published in his 1591
                  translation of Ariosto (which Haydocke had plundered for his
                  translation of Lomazzo):
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    My selfe have seen him, in white and blacke in foure lynes
                    only, set downe the feature of the Queenes Majesties
                    countenaunce; that it was eve[r] thereby to be knowne; and
                    he is so perfect therein . . . that he ca[n] set it downe by
                    the Idea that he hath, without any patterne.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Harington’s observation that Hilliard could work “without any
                  patterne” presumably alludes to the widespread practice of
                  using a “face pattern” in the making of portraits, a topic to
                  which we shall return.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>&nbsp;Yet he may also be trading on the conventions of
                  Aristotelian faculty psychology in which mental pictures (i.e.
                  patterns) are impressed on the memory. Certainly, his comments
                  are reminiscent of Sir Philip Sidney’s Platonic notion of the
                  fore-conceit in <em>The</em> <em>Defence of Poesy</em>, while
                  conveying some of the key qualities of <em>ingegno</em>:
                  sharpness, quickness, and (although this is less common)
                  economical elegance.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>

                <p>
                  We have already encountered the sense of quickness in Ripa,
                  found also in the first English dictionary proper: Robert
                  Cawdrey’s <em>A table alphabeticall</em> (1604), in which
                  “ingenious” is defined as “wittie, quicke witted”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>&nbsp;Sharpness—a visual property of the type of linear image
                  Harington describes, but also a mental quality—pervades
                  translations from or into Latin, such as Thomas Thomas’s 1587
                  translation of <em>perargutus</em> as “Very subtile,
                  ingenious, wittie, and captious”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>&nbsp;Similarly, in one of his annotations to Daniele Barbaro’s
                  edition of Vitruvius (<em>I Dieci Libri dell’Architettura di M. Vitruvio</em>, 1567), Inigo Jones translated “Et questo non solo per
                  dottrina, ma per acutezza d’ingegno si puo fare” as “no rule
                  to teach this but by sharpenes of witt.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>&nbsp;We may note that Sidney, whom Hilliard knew, described “wit”
                  in precisely these terms in his <em>Defence of Poesy</em>,
                  referring to the “point of man’s wit”. Here Sidney deploys the
                  imagery of pen, needle, and sword, in a play on the intimate
                  but oblique relationship of “stylus” to “style”, linking
                  mental acuity with sharp instrument and finessed (but pointed)
                  manner.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>&nbsp;Harington’s comments should be placed within this field of
                  discourse, and he was clearly impressed by the economy of
                  Hilliard’s likeness, created using a refined implement in
                  “foure lynes only”. We might tentatively relate this to the
                  association of ingenuity with both pithiness and with salt,
                  specifically the “Attic salt” of an elegant and succinct turn
                  of phrase, which by 1623 had led Cockeram to include “Atticke”
                  as a definition of “witty”, alongside “ingenious” and
                  “pregnant”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The association of Hilliard with “Attic grace” is not
                  implausible, given that William Scott compares the limner
                  favourably to Apelles in his <em>Model of Poesy</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">22</a></sup>&nbsp;The notion that the limner would have been thought of as
                  pregnant is especially apt. Haydocke deploys this term when
                  translating Lomazzo’s account of the “first inventor of
                  Plasticke” (i.e. modelling), Prometheus, described as a man of
                  “a most pregnant wit and sounde wisedome”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">23</a></sup>&nbsp;This returns us to one of Florio’s translations—“full of
                  invention”—suggesting that the <em>ingegnóso</em> is both
                  ready and replete with wit; perhaps, <em>pace</em> Harington
                  and Sidney, full of ideas or fore-conceits.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">24</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The language of “pregnancy” to denote the intellectual
                  quickness and readiness of “wit” was widespread in the period.
                  As early as 1530 John Palsgrave—an acquaintance of Thomas More
                  and Erasmus—had translated the French “empraignant” as
                  “Quycke/ pregnant of wytte”, while for John Rider in 1589 the
                  Latin “pregnans” meant “A pregnant, or sharpe witte. Acre
                  ingenium. Acutum ingenium.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">25</a></sup>&nbsp;Haydocke’s use of the word is especially appropriate given
                  its connotations of birthing, for Prometheus, we are told,
                  “formed men’s images of earth, adding a certaine artificiall
                  motion unto them, so that they seemed to be indued with spirit
                  and life”. Literally and figuratively, Prometheus is equated
                  with the sort of inspiration sometimes appended to
                  <em>ingegno</em> in the Neoplatonic tradition of poetic
                  fury.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">26</a></sup>&nbsp;Indeed, we see him in the act of “inspiring” in the
                  frontispiece to the <em>Tracte</em>, accompanied by other
                  representatives of the “artes of curious paintinge, carvinge
                  and buildinge”: Juno, Pallas, and Daedalus (<a href="#amarr-fig3">fig. 3</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">27</a></sup>&nbsp;More could be said about the implicit connection here
                  between curiosity and ingenuity, but at the very least we may
                  note that by this date Daedalus was synonymous with ingenuity,
                  as the entry for “Dédalo” in the Perceval–Minsheu
                  Spanish–English dictionary of 1599 shows: “Dedalus, a proper
                  name signifying ingenious.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">28</a></sup>

                  Ingenious/ingenuous: the birth of the liberal artist
                </h1>
                <p>
                  The equation of pregnancy and birthing with ingenuity is part
                  metaphorical, part the result of etymological confusion, since
                  throughout the sixteenth century the Latin
                  <em>ingenium</em> mingled liberally with the word
                  <em>ingenuus</em>, meaning “freeborn” or “noble”. The
                  conflation of these terms, stemming in part from the “natural”
                  aspect of <em>ingenium</em>, is particularly pronounced in
                  sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English, so much so that by
                  1676 Elisha Coles could state in his <em>Dictionary</em> that
                  “Ingenious and Ingenuous, are too often confounded.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">29</a></sup>&nbsp;To a certain extent this slippage is explainable in social
                  terms: in the hierarchical society of early modern England it
                  was natural to ascribe qualities of superior intelligence and
                  ability to the nobility, and the importance of this
                  relationship for the standing of the liberal arts in the
                  Renaissance is well known. For our purposes, we should observe
                  chiefly its significance for the justification of drawing (and
                  therefore painting, which rests upon it) as a liberal art. The
                  introduction of this idea into England via Italy, especially
                  through Thomas Hoby’s translation of Castiglione’s
                  <em>Il cortegiano</em>, has been thoroughly examined and need
                  not be rehearsed, other than to note that it is given full
                  vent by Lomazzo, who in a typical passage asserts: “For to
                  saye the trueth, what Prince or ingenuous man [<em>huomo libero</em>] is there, which taketh not delight, with his pencell to
                  imitate God in Nature, so farre foorth as he is able?”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">30</a></sup>&nbsp;With this in mind it is surely no accident that Haydocke,
                  writing for a socially elite audience that required convincing
                  about the legitimacy of the visual arts, addressed his
                  paratextual letter to “the ingenuous reader”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Let us investigate further the nature of the
                  ingenious–ingenuous nexus in Elizabethan and Jacobean England
                  by considering the economics and aesthetics of freedom,
                  specifically in relation to the status and self-presentation
                  of the visual artist. We will focus especially on Hilliard,
                  singled out by Haydocke as a representative of English
                  <em>ingegno</em>; that is, a native painter whose ability
                  rivals those artists cited by Lomazzo as exemplary, such as
                  Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, and Dürer. As Haydocke
                  explains:
                </p>
                <blockquote>

                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Some seventy years ago, John Pope-Hennessy argued that the
                  treatise in question—the incomplete and only posthumously
                  published <em>Arte of Limning</em> (ca. 1598–1603)—is shot
                  through with the influence of Lomazzo’s treatise in Haydocke’s
                  translation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">32</a></sup>&nbsp;This is evident not least in Hilliard’s assertion that
                  limning is “a kind of gentle painting, of less subjection than
                  any other”, in part by virtue of its ease, cleanliness, and
                  secrecy.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">33</a></sup>&nbsp;But Hilliard is at pains to show that this freedom comes at
                  a price. As he explains:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    [Portrait limning] is for the service of noble persons very
                    meet . . . . And this is a work which of necessity requireth
                    the party’s own presence for the most part of the time, and
                    so it is convenient that they be gentlemen of good parts and
                    ingenuity, either of ability, or made by prince’s fee able
                    so to themselves as to give such seemly attendance on
                    princes as shall not offend their royal presence.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">34</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Here the introduction of a “prince’s fee” into the equation
                  injects a note of tension into the ingenious–ingenuous
                  relationship. Hilliard raises this delicate matter elsewhere
                  in his treatise, where, reflecting on the glories of
                  antiquity, he complains: “Like as one good workman then made
                  another, so one botcher nowadays maketh many, and they
                  increase so fast that good workmen give over to use their best
                  skill, for all men carry one price.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">35</a></sup>&nbsp;This is an echo of Haydocke’s explanation as to why he
                  sought to “increase the knowledge of the Arte [of painting]”
                  by publishing his translation of the <em>Trattato</em>:

                  Both Haydocke’s and Hilliard’s statements reflect the very
                  specific situation of the visual arts in Elizabethan England
                  in comparison to the Continent, not least, in Hilliard’s case,
                  the absence of a regular stipend for his services from the
                  Queen.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">37</a></sup>&nbsp;Yet they speak also to a more general and widespread concern
                  for the relationship of financial means to creative endeavour,
                  encapsulated in the motto
                  <em>Paupertatem summis ingeniis obesse ne provehantur</em>
                  (“Poverty hinders the greatest wits from advancing”). Widely
                  distributed in emblematic form by Alciati and others, it
                  appears in England both in Geoffrey Whitney’s
                  <em>Choice of Emblemes</em> (1586;
                  <a href="#amarr-fig4">fig. 4</a>) and, more elaborately, in
                  Marcus Gheeraerts the elder’s drawing
                  <em>The Unfortunate Painter and his Family</em> (1577;
                  <a href="#amarr-fig5">fig. 5</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">38</a></sup>&nbsp;Both bear a quotation from Juvenal: “Haud facile emergent
                  quorum Virtutibus obstat res angusta domi” (“With difficulty
                  shall they emerge whose virtues are obstructed by poverty at
                  home”). This alerts us to the proper subject of Gheeraert’s
                  drawing, in which a harassed artist turns from his work—and
                  from Mercury, protector of the arts and financial gain—to
                  attend to his mewling infant, needy wife, and brood of unruly
                  children. Hilliard doubtless knew Whitney’s book and it is not
                  impossible that he had seen the Gheeraerts drawing (although
                  the latter seems to have been intended as a gift abroad). The
                  latter, especially, strikes a chord with his cautionary tale
                  of the indigent and otherwise completely unknown painter, John
                  Bossam:

                  Early modern Englishmen routinely equated the ingenuousness of
                  the freeborn nobility with “open-heartedness”. But Hilliard
                  leaves us in no doubt that the liberal stature of the
                  ingenious painter depends not just on an open heart but also
                  on an open purse. Strikingly, this is a two-way street,
                  extending equally to the “good painter” himself. In a curious
                  diatribe against the “common slander . . . that cunning men
                  are ever unthrifts”, Hilliard offers us a compelling picture
                  of the liberal—in every sense of the word—artist. “Such men”,
                  he says,
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    are commonly no misers, but liberal above their little
                    degree, knowing how bountiful God hath endued them with
                    skill above others . . . . And oft times when they have
                    performed a rare piece of work (which indeed they cannot
                    afford) they will give it away to some worthy personage for
                    very affection, and to be spoken of. They . . . serve their
                    fancies, having commonly many children if they be married .
                    . . . If a man bring them a rare piece of work they will
                    give more for it than most men of ten times their
                    ability.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">40</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Beyond what this tells us about the economics of ingenuity,
                  two aspects of the passage stand out. The first is Hilliard’s
                  introduction of God-given talent. He refers to this elsewhere
                  in his treatise, equating the divine gift of artisanal cunning
                  with freedom from slavery:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    God . . . giveth gentility to divers persons, and raiseth
                    man to reputation by divers means . . . he called Bezaleel
                    and Aholiab by name, and filled them with wisdom, skill and
                    understanding, without any teaching, but only of his own
                    gift and grace received. He taught them Himself to be
                    cunning in all fine and curious work . . . being men before
                    brought up but in slavery and making of bricks in
                    captivity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">41</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  There can be little doubt that this deployment of Bezaleel and
                  Aholiab (the artificers of the Ark and the Temple) derives
                  from Haydocke’s Lomazzo, specifically from the physician John
                  Case’s letter to the reader printed therein. Case names both
                  Bezaleel and Aholiab as “cunning men” and cites Exodus 31 to
                  explain why, having read Haydocke’s translation, he now
                  understands “what Aristotle meant in the sixth book of his
                  Ethics, to call Phidias and Polycletus most wise men”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">42</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second significant aspect of Hilliard’s account of the
                  liberal artist is that such men “serve their fancies”. Given
                  the reference to abundant procreation that follows, this is
                  clearly about the licit indulgence of sexual appetite within
                  marriage (which, as per the image by Gheeraerts, literally
                  breeds trouble in the form of needy children). But it pertains
                  also—if we recall some of the definitions of
                  <em>ingegno</em> with which we began—to the free following of
                  imaginative fancy. Does this equate to freedom from rules?
                  After a fashion, since Hilliard, responding to a question from
                  Sir Philip Sidney about the nature of proportion, explains
                  that “our eye is cunning, and is learned without rule by long
                  use.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">43</a></sup>&nbsp;This, too, probably derives from Lomazzo, as we may discern
                  from the important but little known response to Haydocke’s
                  text by Sir Clement Edmondes, in his
                  <em>Observations upon Caesar’s Commentaries</em> (1609):
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Lomazzo . . . saith of a skilfull Painter; that being to
                    draw a portraiture of gracefull lineaments, will never stand
                    to take the symmetry by scale, nor marke it out according to
                    rule: but having his judgement habituated by knowledge, and
                    perfected with the varietie of shapes and proportions; his
                    knowledge guideth his eye, and his eye directeth his hand,
                    and his hand followeth both, with such facilitie of cunning,
                    that each of them serve for a rule whereby the true measures
                    of Nature are exactly expressed.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">44</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  There is not space here to elaborate further upon this swirl
                  of ideas connecting rules, experience, proportion, and
                  cunning. Let us conclude, then, by glancing at a final aspect
                  of freedom: not from rules, but from utility.
                </p>
                <h1 id="proportionate-freedom" tabindex="-1">
                  Proportionate freedom
                </h1>
                <p>
                  This is at the very heart of Hilliard’s arguments as to why
                  limning is “gentle”: “It tendeth not to common men’s use,
                  either for furnishing of houses, or any patterns for
                  tapestries, or building, or any other work whatsoever.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">45</a></sup>&nbsp;Here we have a painter who worked—or so Harington
                  claimed—“without any pattern”, and whose creations are not
                  intended to <em>be</em> patterns.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">46</a></sup>&nbsp;This is a striking inversion of the standard arguments for
                  painting’s worth circulating in learned circles at the time,
                  such as John Dee’s in his account of the “Mechanical Zographer
                  (commonly called the Painter)” in the “Mathematical Preface”
                  to Henry Billingsley’s English translation of Euclid’s
                  <em>Elements</em>:

                <p>
                  This liberal attitude towards painting is undoubtedly
                  connected to contemporary English poetics concerned with how
                  pictorial and literary mimesis relate to moral exemplars, the
                  best known expression of which is Sidney’s in the
                  <em>Defence</em>. There, Sidney distinguishes “the meaner sort
                  of painters, who counterfeit only such faces as are set before
                  them” from “the more excellent, who having no law but wit” can
                  “paint the outward beauty of virtue”, without ever having
                  <em>seen</em> the paragon concerned.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">50</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite their acquaintance, it is perhaps doubtful that
                  Hilliard shared Sidney’s view, not least since he seems
                  obstinately literal in his conviction that “all painting
                  imitateth nature, or the life.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">51</a></sup>&nbsp;But a connection may yet be found in the very topic about
                  which the poet questioned the painter: proportion. Central to
                  Lomazzo’s conception of art, “good proportion” is, according
                  to Hilliard, the “greater part” of beauty: “Whereof our divine
                  part . . . by an admirable instinct of nature judgeth
                  generally.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">52</a></sup>&nbsp;This is the stuff of <em>ingegno</em>: a natural instinct of
                  the liberal artist. Yet strikingly, this aesthetic quality
                  pertains not just to the artist, but also to his creations. As
                  Lomazzo explained: “All the inventions of men carry with them
                  so much the more grace and beauty, by how much the more
                  ingenuously [<em>ingegniosamente</em>] they are
                  proportioned.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53">53</a></sup>&nbsp;Thus, ingenuity in Renaissance England was not simply an
                  attribute of the artist, nor was it solely a social bond
                  between him and his patron. Ingenuity had the capacity to be
                  an aesthetic property, an affective quality of the work of art
                  exemplifying the talents of its maker and exciting the curious
                  admiration of the beholder.

                        We may note a certain tension here between Hilliard’s
                        rhetorical claims for his art (and Harington’s praise of
                        it) and actual practice, since not only did Hilliard
                        effectively rely upon a face pattern for his later
                        portraits of Elizabeth (the famous “mask of youth”), he
                        also made designs to be reproduced in other media, for
                        example for the Queen’s Great Seal (1584; Victoria &amp;
                        Albert Museum). There is, though, a subtle difference
                        between Hilliard’s reliance on a pattern committed to
                        memory and the deployment of a physical face pattern in
                        the reproduction of portraits.

                        Trevilian’s “patterns” against the work of Hilliard,
                        especially (as discussed above) his later portraits of
                        Elizabeth. However, there remains a distinction between
                        Hilliard’s mimetic art, rooted in (as he says) “long
                        use” and the memory, and unmediated copying from a
                        two-dimensional model.

                  Frederick H. Evans (1853–1943) spent the turn of the twentieth
                  century photographing English and French cathedrals, always

                  comprehended when his promotion of glass over paper is

                  In an iconic photograph, Frederick H. Evans (1853–1943) frames
                  Lincoln Cathedral in an ethereal, weightless mist above the
                  industrial town below, its spired towers reaching heavenward
                  away from the patchwork of properties in the foreground (1898;
                  <a href="#kfiedorek-fig1">fig. 1</a>). In Evans’s words, this
                  general view suggests “the crowning effect” the cathedral
                  gives the East Midlands city, “the grandeur, the atmosphere
                  and sense of quietude, the feeling of past greatness, the
                  aloofness from the current and contemporary”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  Evans spent nearly three decades photographing English and
                  French cathedrals, always using the church to figure a
                  particularly late Victorian alarm at the lost vitality these
                  medieval structures symbolized. Cathedrals ameliorated a
                  pervasive sense of religious and cultural enfeeblement felt on
                  both sides of the Atlantic at the turn of the century: Henry
                  Adams wrote in the same years that “Ennui had driven him to
                  Chartres” to learn what that “mass of encrusted architecture
                  meant to its builders”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  In defiance of quickening amateur technologies that shaped
                  this nascent “snapshot” era, Evans maintained a slow and
                  deliberate photographic process that brought him into
                  communion with the antiquity and authenticity of
                  ecclesiastical architecture.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>

                  Photography for Evans was akin to a religious practice
                  involving time, labour, and repetition like the
                  multi-generational construction of cathedrals, and he
                  habitually spent weeks studying them and waiting for the
                  moment of revelation. His friend and colleague Alvin Langdon
                  Coburn recalled later that “The visit of Evans to a cathedral
                  town was a solemn Rite. He went there and lived.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  As the general view of Lincoln Cathedral’s thin,
                  double-bordered mount and dramatic, high-contrast printing in
                  platinum attests, Evans was not only a perceptive and skilful
                  photographer but also a creative <em>presenter</em> of
                  photographs. His innovative framing devices and exhibition
                  designs for the London photographic&nbsp;club the Linked Ring
                  (1892–1910) earned him universal acclaim, while they
                  simultaneously expressed a newly physical notion of
                  experiencing religious architecture through the
                  photograph.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today Evans holds a significant place in the history of
                  photography for such pristine platinum prints, but this was
                  only part of his contribution to the international campaign
                  for photography as art connected with turn-of-the-century
                  Pictorialism. An under-studied but essential component of his
                  work is the more than one thousand lantern slides he made in
                  the first twenty years of his career, until failing eyesight
                  forced him to stop producing slides in 1902. This abrupt
                  conclusion partially explains the almost total lack of
                  attention to this format in existing scholarship on Evans,
                  which is undoubtedly due in part to a perceived
                  incompatibility between the mass-market associations of slides
                  with the career of a pre-eminent art photographer.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  However, the process of making photographs of Anglican and
                  Catholic structures <em>on glass</em> had an enduring
                  relevance to the way Evans conceived of his elegiac images on
                  similar themes <em>on paper</em>. The print of Lincoln
                  Cathedral pictures a faith that was becoming increasingly
                  remote to modern culture, while the lantern slides he made of
                  the cathedral recuperate this same loss in a more directly
                  experiential, bodily, and, as this article will argue,
                  mystical way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Evans approached the transparent medium in an essentially
                  redemptive manner: he advocated vocally in the photographic
                  press throughout the early 1900s for pictorial photographers
                  to rescue the potentially inartistic lantern slide, by then
                  firmly associated with dry lecturers and spectacular
                  entertainment, for the purposes of making art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  More than any other format, transparencies for Evans
                  dramatized enduring connections between photography and divine
                  light, and their centrality to what many viewers have
                  identified as the spiritual presence of light in his
                  photographs merits further attention.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                  If the genesis of the photographic image in light was read in
                  theological terms immediately upon its conception, the lantern
                  slide that visibly operated by a stream of light contributed
                  in salient ways to Evans’s broader project of eulogizing
                  sacred architecture.

                <p>
                  The significance of religion to nineteenth- and early
                  twentieth-century photography has largely escaped modern
                  viewers, though matters of faith frequently shaped how
                  photographers approached their medium and how contemporary
                  audiences read their images. Despite a strong bias within the
                  literature on Evans towards aesthetics, consistent with the
                  larger tendency to excise social and historical dimensions
                  from the discussion of Pictorialism, the religious motivations
                  and meanings of his photography have been studied in
                  connection with several of his works on paper, especially
                  those that make the link explicit in titles taken from the
                  Church of England’s Book of Common Prayer.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  This article extends and complicates that approach by
                  exploring the mystical resonances of his stated preference for
                  glass as a support, a matter that has been long overlooked
                  despite the fact that he published extensively on the
                  topic.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                  Evans’s lantern slides of Lincoln Cathedral, made in 1895 and
                  presented in lectures for photographic societies between 1896
                  and 1902, offer a unique opportunity to revisit this formative
                  aspect of his practice and its relation to his deeply held
                  mystical beliefs. Evans found theoretical and formal
                  inspiration in the enthusiastic writings of the German mystic
                  Jakob Böhme (1575–1624), who sought to re-absorb belief in
                  guidance by divine impulses into Lutheranism, and principally
                  in the work of the Swedish mystic Emanuel Swedenborg
                  (1688–1772), who investigated the divine properties of light
                  and seeing and on whom Evans published.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The manner in which Evans’s images of cathedrals embody a way
                  of perceiving religious space that is indebted to Christian
                  mysticism is clear in his writings on Swedenborg, which
                  resonate conceptually with his many articles on photography on
                  glass. The physical format in which his slides were exhibited
                  at one representative lecture on the architectural history of
                  Lincoln Cathedral delivered in 1902, likely before a London
                  photographic club, also illuminates this affinity between
                  photography and faith by fostering a sympathetic engagement
                  with projected imagery of the church.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                  Evans’s Swedenborgian belief system not only provided a
                  subtext but also shaped the nature of this and similar
                  lectures, probing beyond the realm of newly prevalent
                  photographic reproductions of famous works of art and
                  buildings that simply duplicated their referents. Evans’s
                  methods were informed by religious ideas whose ultimate goal
                  was to regain the originary state of unmediated spiritual
                  vision described by Swedenborg: photography on glass was the
                  purest expression of this project.

                </h1>
                <p>
                  Pronouncements of an ebbing faith were pervasive in Victorian
                  and Edwardian Britain. Already in 1843, Thomas Carlyle raised
                  the alarm about religion’s replacement by utilitarian
                  philosophies and scientific progress: “There is no longer any
                  God for us! God’s Laws are become a Greatest-Happiness
                  Principle, a Parliamentary Expediency; the Heavens an
                  Astronomical Time-Keeper; a butt for Herschel telescopes to
                  shoot science at.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  The challenges presented to religious belief by positivism
                  continued to gain force and energy throughout the century. By
                  1873, Matthew Arnold wrote that to “re-inthrone” the Bible to
                  its former supremacy in English consciousness would be “as
                  impossible as to restore the feudal system, or the belief in
                  witches”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>
                  The overarching sense at the turn of the century that orthodox
                  Christianity was discredited, even at an end, gives special
                  poignancy to Evans’s photographs of deserted cathedrals, where
                  pews await worshippers who never arrive (<a href="#kfiedorek-fig2">fig. 2</a>). Evans later became known for asking deans to remove the
                  pews for the hours he spent making negatives, revealing his
                  desire to evacuate signs of modern life from his views. For
                  Evans, the furnishings of worship had become superfluous: the
                  buildings themselves provided the genuine religious experience
                  that he sought to capture in his images.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
                  In this sense, the emptiness of Evans’s cathedrals rescued
                  these spaces from parochialism and their fraught histories as
                  Catholic structures violently appropriated by Anglicans in the
                  sixteenth century, offering them up to a more universal,

                <p>
                  Growing up in London in the 1850s and 1860s during the period
                  of feverish church building and restoration that followed the
                  Oxford Movement, Evans saw firsthand that a society losing its
                  interest in religious tradition continued to invest in the
                  physical authority of churches, even as churchgoing itself
                  declined. The historian Clive Field estimates that by the
                  Edwardian era, only one quarter of adults, largely women,
                  attended mass on any given Sunday.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>
                  Evans blamed ecclesiastical institutions for the absence of a
                  “vital religious sense” among the people: “It must be that the
                  Churches and their ministers have lost hold, by their manifest
                  unrelatedness to daily life, their unreality, the
                  impossibility of making their doctrines real and valid in
                  practice.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>
                  There is a pointed irony in the fact that Evans’s lectures on
                  Lincoln Cathedral and similar structures brought his early
                  twentieth-century audiences—exactly those who went to church
                  less frequently—into a long and meaningful encounter with a
                  cathedral, forcing them to linger on something that was
                  becoming increasingly alien in lived experience. Given that
                  slide presentations require an audience, the presumably
                  occupied chairs of the secular lecture space symbolically
                  substituted for the vacant pews on view.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Already accustomed to the rise of secularism to some extent,
                  Evans’s late Victorian and Edwardian contemporaries often
                  looked nostalgically upon religion and religious subjects. In
                  his seminal <em>Varieties of Religious Experience</em> (1902),
                  William James was less eager to throw the baby out with the
                  bathwater than some of his forebears, recognizing that
                  religion “adds to life an enchantment which is not rationally
                  or logically deducible from anything else”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>
                  If religion was to survive, it had to be a modern, everyday
                  kind, one that was more flexible than what Emerson called the
                  “withered traditional church yielding dry catechisms”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>
                  Herein lay the attraction of the eighteenth-century Swedish
                  mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, whose voluminous, anti-creedal
                  writings on the permeability of the natural and spiritual
                  worlds made Evans “all the more impatient with the official
                  pulpit”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup>
                  Although Swedenborg never commanded a huge popular following
                  in the “market situation” of religious volunteerism that
                  emerged in industrial England, he intrigued many artistic and
                  intellectual luminaries in the eighteenth and nineteenth
                  centuries, including Blake, Coleridge, Emerson, and Henry
                  James, Sr.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">22</a></sup>
                  Evans primarily encountered Swedenborg through James (whom he
                  considered “perhaps the most acute and profound theological
                  thinker of his century”) and even more thoroughly through the
                  scholar and homeopathic physician James John Garth Wilkinson
                  (1812–1899).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">23</a></sup>
                  Evans wrote to Wilkinson that his English translations and
                  several volumes on Swedenborg from the 1840s to 1890s were
                  “celestial food” for the photographer.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">24</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Where Swedenborg offered a fundamental “fullness of message”,
                  Evans valued Wilkinson’s interpretation of his mystical
                  writings for “the perfect picture-making effect of so many of
                  the sentences”. Evans corresponded with Wilkinson in 1886 and
                  wrote his biography to celebrate the centenary of his birth in
                  1912, which is essentially a short book on Swedenborg. Part of
                  these letters details a publication Evans proposed that would
                  include selections from Wilkinson’s writings, which he
                  considered “emphatically the public medicine now most needed”,
                  to gain Wilkinson and Swedenborgian thought a larger popular
                  following. Evans wanted to title this
                  <em>Christian Verities for Daily Life Being Passages from the
                    Writings of James John Garth Wilkinson</em>, and to organize it around Swedenborgian themes such as
                  Divine Influx, the Second Coming, Incarnation, and
                  Justification by Faith Alone, including those excerpts from
                  Wilkinson “most valuable and in most urgent need for the
                  awakening and teaching of this recalcitrant age”. In his
                  mid-seventies at the time, Wilkinson politely declined and the
                  anthology never materialized. However, from his studies of the
                  Swedish mystic through the English author, Evans formulated an
                  informal “workaday Gospel” and a conviction that “the
                  practical religious sense, a living for and in communion with
                  the invisible, must be made to invade, to permeate the
                  business life”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">25</a></sup>
                  Swedenborgian theories of vision infused his own professional
                  life as a photographer and form a critical subtext to his
                  photographs, especially those on glass.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In terms of his photography, Evans looked to Swedenborg
                  especially for a philosophy of perception, an extrasensory
                  form of sight, and a spiritual context for artistic form,
                  rather than a creed. Swedenborg represented a self-consciously
                  modern, enlightened form of Christian thought, one that was
                  more accommodating to the materialism and scientific progress
                  of the late nineteenth century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">26</a></sup>
                  He rejected the idea that a large spatial, temporal, or
                  metaphysical gap exists between this world and that of the
                  dead; inspired by Romans 1:20 (“For the invisible things of
                  him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being
                  understood by the things that are made”), he believed that
                  nature was created to clothe the spiritual. As Henry James,
                  Sr., put it: “nature for Swedenborg is not a being but a
                  seeming (it is apparitional, phenomenal); it is a shadow, not
                  substance.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">27</a></sup>
                  The Mystic’s hypothesis of our constant nexus with an
                  invisible world, where a person is successful according to the
                  measure of his or her obedience to inspiration from beyond,
                  resonated with Evans’s approach to photography from the
                  beginning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Evans started his career in photography by making
                  photomicrographs as lantern slides for his friend George Smith
                  in 1883 (<a href="#kfiedorek-fig3">fig. 3</a>); he won an
                  award for these from the Royal Photographic Society in 1887,
                  at a time when he was deeply engaged in Swedenborgian thought
                  and corresponding with Wilkinson.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">28</a></sup>
                  As the image of a cross-section of a sea urchin’s spine
                  suggests, the camera immediately became a tool of making
                  visible an invisible world and extending the range of human
                  vision—a religiously rooted precursor to the New Vision
                  photography emerging after the First World War. According to
                  categories proposed by James Coates’s
                  <em>Photographing the Invisible</em> (1911), an interest in
                  the “material invisible” (such as X-rays or photomicrographs)
                  gave way to one in the “immaterial invisible” (which Coates
                  equates with the psychic but could also be more generally
                  metaphysical) for Evans as he moved from scientific to
                  architectural views.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">29</a></sup>
                  Throughout, the light-sensitivity of the gelatin bromide
                  emulsion on his glass negatives provided a model of
                  sensitivity to unseen or interior forces, generally referred
                  to as “influx” by Swedenborg.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">30</a></sup>

                  Evans’s descriptions of the ontology of photography and
                  Swedenborgian perception are closely related. Where
                  photography “only recalls; it does not create”, an attuned
                  individual might discern the spiritual significance of the
                  visible world as outlined in Swedenborg’s theory of
                  correspondences:<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">31</a></sup>

                    himself; . . . We only form, give body and appearance to

                <p>
                  Evans’s religiously inflected photography was a uniquely
                  powerful medium for insisting upon those
                  <em>latent</em> presences beyond the reach of the naked eye
                  and for educating one’s senses in detecting the living reality
                  underlying the surfaces of things. A better understanding of
                  his religious beliefs gives new meaning to his demonstrated
                  interest in printing his photographs of cathedrals as lantern
                  slides beginning in the mid-1880s. In a Swedenborgian
                  epistemology where the material and celestial worlds are
                  contiguous and in constant communication, Evans felt this veil
                  to be at its thinnest in the sacred spaces of cathedrals: the
                  glass transparency materialized this permeability.

                <p>
                  Though it displays some of the same affinities, this
                  extrasensory perception differs significantly from the popular
                  phenomenon of spirit photography, where double-exposed prints
                  brought portrait sitters into communion with the spectral
                  image of the recently departed. While the photographic press
                  generally considered spirit photographers “barefaced
                  impostors”, the late Victorian British public countenanced the
                  veracity of their images far more than in the United States
                  and France, so that they particularly riled a purist like
                  Evans.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">33</a></sup>
                  As a self-described “red-hot enthusiast” for pure photography,
                  Evans adamantly opposed any such multiple exposures and
                  believed that only a process of perceiving the subject slowly
                  and over successive encounters, not in the spectacle of a
                  séance or a commercial studio, could yield meaningful
                  correspondences.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">34</a></sup>
                  He considered spirit photographs “easy puerilities” that told
                  only of the psychic needs of humans, not heavenly
                  communications.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">35</a></sup>
                  As someone sympathetic to Christian mysticism, he believed
                  visions were spontaneously given by the grace of God, rather
                  than purposefully summoned as for spiritualists.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">36</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Swedenborg reported experiencing what his late
                  nineteenth-century readers, most notably William James, called
                  “photisms”, or flashes of light, during his moments of deepest
                  insight.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">37</a></sup>
                  For Evans, camera technology had very specific mystical
                  associations given the opening of the lens to allow for
                  influx, the plate’s receptivity to immaterial forces, and the
                  final image’s augmentation of the reality of the unseen. As
                  Evans told one interviewer: “I myself cannot paint or draw;
                  but I have Vision, and photography lets me put down what I
                  see.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">38</a></sup>
                  Swedenborg described the state of communication in the “Most
                  Ancient Church” as an “internal respiration” of
                  perceptions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">39</a></sup>
                  Given his presumption of a direct and untroubled transfer from
                  his perception as a viewing subject to the final print or
                  slide, it is easy to imagine how Evans regarded photography as
                  the fulfilment of Swedenborg’s encouragement to relearn an
                  immediate, direct, and involuntary vision that was not reliant
                  on representation but was more akin to breathing. Evans’s
                  glass slides reclaimed some sense of unmediated contact with
                  the infinite that overcame the seeming remoteness of the
                  experience of cathedrals. The lantern slide that transmitted
                  light, physically moving rays between seemingly separate
                  spheres at the border of which the photographic glass stood as
                  both dividing and uniting line, was in profound sympathy with
                  his religious perspective.

                  In parsing the connection between Evans’s photography on glass
                  and Swedenborgian mysticism, it is worth thinking in broader
                  terms about the experience of the magic lantern show around
                  1900 and how it structured the reception of the photographic
                  image.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">40</a></sup>
                  In <em>Swann’s Way</em> (1913), Marcel Proust marvelled at the
                  miraculous vividness of the magic lantern that distracted him
                  from his childhood fits of bad temper:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    After the fashion of the master-builders and glass-painters
                    of Gothic days, it substituted for the opaqueness of my
                    walls an impalpable iridescence, supernatural phenomena of
                    many colours, in which legends were depicted as on a
                    shifting and transitory window . . . The body of Golo
                    himself, being of the same supernatural substance as his
                    steed’s, overcame every material obstacle—everything that
                    seemed to bar his way—by taking it as an ossature and
                    absorbing it into himself: even the door-knob—on which,
                    adapting themselves at once, his red cloak or his pale face,
                    still as noble and as melancholy, floated invincibly—would
                    never betray the least concern at this transvertebration.
                    And, indeed, I found plenty of charm in these bright
                    projections, which seemed to emanate from a Merovingian past
                    and shed around me the reflections of such ancient
                    history.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">41</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Conjoining iconography from the Early Middle Ages and the
                  projected image, Proust characterizes the magic lantern as a
                  vehicle that moves the experience of a stained glass window
                  into new sites and contexts, namely, his bedroom. It is safe
                  to say, however, that Proust was not talking about photographs
                  when he describes colourful imagery from this medieval legend,
                  because Proust generally considered photographs banal,
                  utilitarian, and vulgar.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">42</a></sup>
                  His account of this transubstantiative experience raises an
                  important problem for understanding the context in which Evans
                  produced his lantern slides: in Walter Benjamin’s era of
                  mechanical reproduction, had photography robbed the magic
                  lantern of its magic?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">43</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As opposed to painting, the prosaic exactitude offered by the
                  camera might seem to undermine Evans’s unspoken goal of
                  attaining a higher visionary state. Misty landscapes by the
                  American painter George Inness (1825–1894) have been taken as
                  the pre-eminent expression of Swedenborgian faith in
                  nineteenth-century art, predicated on the idea that spiritual
                  sight is opened when physical sight is compromised.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">44</a></sup>
                  When it came to colour theory, Evans’s interpretation of
                  Swedenborg’s tenets in a monochrome medium was necessarily
                  looser than Inness’s version, where hues held specific
                  spiritual qualities. For Inness, photographic detail offered
                  no gain in meaning: “The memory is the daguerreotype shop of
                  the soul which treasures all God creates through eye and
                  touch. What we painters have to learn is to keep this shop
                  closed in the presence of nature: to see, and not to think we
                  see.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">45</a></sup>
                  Inness apprehended what he called “the reality of the unseen”
                  through a wilful blindness, while Evans sought the same
                  through a cultivated hyper-vision.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">46</a></sup>
                  To be sure, photography’s perceived illusionism and
                  pervasiveness in modern culture aligned it more closely with
                  the core of Swedenborgian thought in terms of a descent of
                  religion into everyday life—what Henry James, Sr., called “no
                  longer a sunday but a week-day divinity, a working God”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">47</a></sup>
                  At the same time as photography provided a desirable
                  vernacular, its presentation in the lantern slide, which
                  relied on light piercing through the solid medium of glass,
                  could evocatively penetrate beyond the surfaces of the visible
                  world.

                  Even before being projected, the fact that lantern slides
                  constituted a positive version of the glass negative—still
                  used by many “serious” photographers like Evans as against the
                  newly available roll film immediately embraced by
                  amateurs—invested the format with primal, auratic qualities.
                  When projected, Evans seems to have thought that photographic
                  transparencies were magical precisely for their ability to
                  viscerally transport the viewer into the scene at hand (<a href="#kfiedorek-fig4">figs. 4</a>
                  and <a href="#kfiedorek-fig5">5</a>). He included other media
                  like an “old” engraving in his lecture on Lincoln Cathedral in
                  1902 to reinforce this point that photography was more
                  “valuable” and “truthful”. Only when the cathedral itself
                  presented obstacles to photographs (i.e. lack of scaffolding)
                  did he make recourse to lithographs, preferring the “absolute
                  fac-simile photography alone can give”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">48</a></sup>
                  In this vein, Evans was exceedingly “obstinate” about ideal
                  viewing conditions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">49</a></sup>
                  A low point of sight made the scene most natural, “so alive
                  and real as to yield the notion that all one has to do is to
                  get up and to walk into the picture before one”, a
                  complementary vehicle for his photographs whose “chief aim”
                  was to “give the irresistible feeling that one <em>is</em> in
                  an interior, and that it is fully of light and space”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">50</a></sup>
                  In principle, the image became coextensive with the interior
                  in which it was projected, so that the photograph was less a
                  discrete picture than an immersive environment dramatically
                  illuminating the darkened space of viewing and suffusing with
                  light any architectural interruptions like Proust’s door-knob.
                  The projected image united the depicted architectural space
                  with the actual architectural space of the lecture hall so
                  that the enlarged photograph even sacralized the presumably
                  non-religious site of the lecture. For instance, the inclusion
                  of walls on either side of one slide pre-empts the lines of a
                  hall and invites the viewer into the meeting-room at the far
                  end, eliding the pictured church and the audience’s space of
                  viewing (<a href="#kfiedorek-fig6">fig. 6</a>). As Proust’s
                  magic lantern flooded his childhood bedroom with a medieval
                  legend, the lantern slide brought the Gothic cathedral into a
                  present-tense space.

                <p>
                  The insistent immediacy of Evans’s photographic lantern
                  lectures was compounded by the enduring connections between
                  both divine providence and light, specifically in the form of
                  a lantern, and between divine agency and photography as
                  <em>light-writing</em>. William Holman Hunt’s sensationally
                  popular <em>The Light of the World</em> (1853) provided a
                  model for images of lanternists as Christ-like wayfarers
                  bearing the message of light to a public in need of salvation.
                  Since the official announcement of photography’s invention in
                  1839, the light of Heaven, the blessed sun, the Eternal eye,
                  and even God himself had consistently been invoked as the true
                  authors of a photograph.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">51</a></sup>
                  Magic lanterns were one technology in a wider network of
                  popular entertainment including the diorama and panorama;
                  though they were by no means exclusively religious, they were
                  seized upon to illustrate the edifying potential of the
                  lecture format and the symbolic valences of light. Indeed, the
                  magic lantern was warmly embraced by religious organizations
                  by the 1890s, from evangelical and missionary groups to
                  temperance societies and Sunday schools, as well as famous
                  American reformers associated with the Social Gospel movement
                  like Jacob Riis, who described his magic lantern lectures on
                  tenement conditions as “fit topics for any sermon”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">52</a></sup>
                  There are even accounts of lantern slide observances in
                  British churches, for example a Good Friday lantern service
                  held in 1902 at St Mary’s Church in Torquay, a seaside town in
                  Devon.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53">53</a></sup>
                  This rich cultural nexus between light, photography,
                  Christianity, and the magic lantern suggests how the realist
                  view of the photograph as an unmediated duplication of nature
                  gained pronounced religious dimensions in the slide show.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Relative to paper, Evans thought transparencies had a “more
                  potent, more magic power of suggestion”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54">54</a></sup>
                  There is a tragic appropriateness to the fact that these
                  images, so invested in engendering a keener vision, should
                  eventually lead to the deterioration of Evans’s eyesight,
                  leading him to work almost exclusively in platinum prints. On
                  the topic of glass versus paper, Evans wrote:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Photography is an art-method that relies on a presentment of
                    the image given in planes, enveloped in atmosphere, real,
                    and not suggested or simulated by lines or washes; and that
                    fully to exploit these,
                    <em>the final base of the image should be as nearly
                      transparent as the original vehicle, air replaced by
                      glass</em>, so that when one sees the final shaping of our picture,
                    it shall be as nearly <em>free and intangible</em> as any
                    recalling of the original can hope or expect to get. Glass,
                    not paper, I submit, gives the perfect expression of the
                    perfect photograph.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55">55</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The ambition here is nothing short of the modernist desire to
                  transcend the material objecthood of the work of art, to
                  etherealize the photograph by making it transient, weightless,
                  and transparent. As Proust would make more explicit a few
                  years later, a sympathetic attraction emerges with the
                  medieval stained glass window, which was an important
                  precedent for this use of transmitted light through glass to
                  dematerialize space. Evans preferred this temporary projection
                  of images onto walls to their chemical absorption into paper,
                  which he felt presented an “arbitrary stoppage” of the
                  image.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56">56</a></sup>
                  This helps explain why his lantern slides tend to be more
                  frontal and less oblique than the prints for which he is
                  famous, beyond their straightforwardly instructive purpose.
                  For example, the slide of the Chapter House at Lincoln enfolds
                  the viewer in its space in contrast to the teasing recession
                  and withheld gratification of one of Evans’s well-known
                  prints, <em>Ely Cathedral: View into Nave</em> (1900;
                  <a href="#kfiedorek-fig7">fig. 7</a>). Evans incorporated a
                  more dynamic sensation of passage or trajectory into the print
                  to compensate for what he understood to be its “stoppage” of
                  the experience. The lantern slide’s conveyance of “innumerable
                  planes inseparably connected”, on the other hand, instantiates
                  a Swedenborgian understanding of nature as having no end but
                  rather an ascent from thing to thing; paper could not
                  accommodate this sense of infinity and flux as
                  effectively.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57">57</a></sup>

                <p>
                  There were also tremendous differences in the social aspects
                  of viewing a photograph on glass versus one on paper that
                  further supported Evans’s aim to help his audience develop
                  “the seeing eye”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58">58</a></sup>
                  This focus on religion as a social phenomenon of mystic
                  participation was consonant with the period’s great works in
                  comparative religion, from James’s
                  <em>Varieties of Religious Experience</em> to Emile Durkheim’s
                  <em>The Elementary Forms of Religious Life</em> (1912). Magic
                  lanterns inspired communal viewing in which substantial
                  audiences all focused on one and the same image at a given
                  time rather than picking and choosing from the densely packed
                  salon-style hangings of photographic exhibitions. In place of
                  the contingent meanings existing between different prints on
                  the wall was a radical and deep concentration on a single
                  subject. Evans’s performance as lecturer, guiding the audience
                  through each view, was (per Riis) not unlike a sermon on the
                  cathedral, and indeed churches and mission halls were frequent
                  venues for lantern shows in this period. The much larger scale
                  of the photographic image in a lantern show as well as the
                  experience of slides unfolding in time shaped a viewing
                  environment that echoed Evans’s own process of training eye
                  and memory through close study. In other words, the
                  phenomenology of Evans’s slides worked to counteract the
                  “unreality” of medieval houses of worship in modern life by
                  creating a real-time, virtual experience. Unlike the
                  “abnormal” and “over-actual” stereograph, the optical lantern
                  provided “as perfect a translation as possible” of the
                  original photographic negative, so that Evans could help
                  “fulfill [the lantern’s] manifest destiny as the great
                  educational instrument of the future” in teaching his audience
                  how to see a church in all its spiritual significance.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59">59</a></sup>

                  Evans’s pictures counterbalance a lost and regained religious
                  feeling in a way that enacts the corollary between stained
                  glass windows and photography on glass (<a href="#kfiedorek-fig8">fig. 8</a>). Fragile Gothic windows had almost always been destroyed by
                  hostile human action over intervening centuries, and this
                  destruction became a ripe metaphor for comparing a glorious,
                  coherent past with a degraded, fragmented present. For Evans
                  in his 1902 lecture, this “makes one again sigh and long for
                  the treasures of old glass that our Philistine forefathers so
                  ruthlessly and stupidly destroyed”, lamenting the demolition
                  of the originals by Puritan soldiers during the English
                  Reformation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60">60</a></sup>
                  As such, the stained glass window symbolized religious
                  conflict and the fragility of one creed’s dominion over
                  another, an ugly sectarian history from which Swedenborgians
                  stood apart. What is more, as liminal objects—the early
                  fourteenth-century Dominican Gulielmus Durandus wrote on the
                  dual role of windows to keep out the elements and to allow the
                  light of God to filter in—both windows and lantern slides
                  transmit light rather than merely reflect it, which protracts
                  and redirects photography’s genesis in light.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61">61</a></sup>
                  Halation in the arched windows gives a true sense of how light
                  dematerializes space, overcoming the limestone’s physical
                  confines photographically much like Proust described the
                  effect of the magic lantern as one of
                  <em>transvertébration</em>, literally a moving across spinal
                  columns.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The physical force of light in Evans’s photographs of
                  cathedrals was equally palpable as projected light in the dark
                  space of the lecture hall. The art historian John Harvey has
                  noted that the magic lantern is technically the opposite of a
                  camera; where the camera takes in light to form the image, the
                  magic lantern emits illumination, concretizing the agency of
                  light.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn62" id="fnref62">62</a></sup>
                  Even in Evans’s platinotypes, however, darkness is never truly
                  dark, which connects his slides to the prints that came to
                  dominate his later practice.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn63" id="fnref63">63</a></sup>
                  One critic remarked upon how Evans’s treatment of light
                  conveyed an impression of “unseen presence”, while another
                  wrote that his photographs produce the illogical impression
                  “that there is more light inside a building than there is
                  outside it”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn64" id="fnref64">64</a></sup>
                  Evans used double-emulsion Sandell film to hold excellent
                  detail in the shadows, which was registered by platinum’s long
                  tonal range despite its low to moderate contrast. As George
                  Bernard Shaw wrote of his friend’s work, “the obscurest detail
                  in the corners seem as delicately penciled by the darkness as
                  the flood of sunshine through window or open door is penciled
                  by the light.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn65" id="fnref65">65</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Marshalling Swedenborgian ideas of correspondence and the
                  reality of the unseen, Evans’s materials emphasized how light
                  forces continuity between spheres that appear physically
                  separate, re-investing the vacant cathedral with spiritual
                  life. This marks a subtle but important difference from the
                  only imagery he credited as a source of inspiration, in J. M.
                  W. Turner’s early watercolours of cathedrals. Though he
                  admired these “tiny masterpieces” for their formal attributes,
                  including their “superb sense of height, bigness, light,
                  atmosphere, grandeur”, they could not embody the scale,
                  duration, visceral three-dimensionality, and mystical potency
                  of his projected photographs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn66" id="fnref66">66</a></sup>

                  The communication of divine experience at Lincoln Cathedral
                </h1>
                <p>
                  While his 1902 lecture on Lincoln Cathedral was putatively
                  scholarly, it simultaneously exemplified Evans’s tacit
                  ambition to cultivate Swedenborgian vision, a heightened
                  faculty of sight attentive to how the symbolic language of the
                  divine resides in the material world. Moving from the general
                  to the particular, from the outside of the cathedral to the
                  inside, Evans summons the process of influx of divine energy
                  streaming in as he progressively narrows in on details with
                  specific meaning to Swedenborgians. Craftsmanship and
                  attendant issues of scale are a primary modality linking
                  Evans’s lantern slides to a way of seeing inflected by the
                  Christian Mystic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Evans contextualized his image of Lincoln’s intricate choir
                  stalls carved by medieval builders with Augustus Pugin’s
                  commendment of their craftsmanship as “the finest examples of
                  woodwork in the kingdom, both for rarity and beauty of design
                  and for accuracy of workmanship” (<a href="#kfiedorek-fig9">fig. 9</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn67" id="fnref67">67</a></sup>
                  Evans was a disciple of William Morris, who used photographic
                  slides to enlarge and replicate medieval typographies for his
                  Kelmscott Press and also designed celebrated stained glass
                  windows for Morris &amp; Co. Both artists recognized in the
                  humble medieval craftsman a purposefulness and even
                  anti-authoritarianism that appealed to their unconventional
                  sensibilities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn68" id="fnref68">68</a></sup>
                  Evans’s painstaking methods replicated the craftsmanship he
                  pictured: his repeated use of the zoom-in, such as in the
                  stone sculptures of the Judgment Porch, photographically
                  simulates the medieval artisan’s crafting of details and the
                  progressive revelation of information to a visitor to the
                  site.

                  Photo-historian Anne Hammond has argued that selecting from
                  the innumerable planes of focus parallel to the ground glass
                  in his architectural views owes a great deal to Evans’s early
                  work with a microscope, whose extremely shallow depth of field
                  trained him to move zoom-lens-like through successive planes
                  in the subject.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn69" id="fnref69">69</a></sup>
                  Making slides of cathedrals involved shifts in scale in
                  <em>both</em> directions: rather than contact printing the
                  glass negative, he used a reducing camera to shrink the image
                  (the strong summer light necessary for this reduction work is
                  what caused his eyesight to deteriorate) before enlarging it
                  again through projection. He repeatedly mentions this fact of
                  enlargement throughout his lecture. On this question of scale,
                  Evans describes the oak choir stalls as a “forest of
                  pinnacles”, emphasizing that they are a miniature version of
                  the spires of the cathedral itself, whose prototype in nature
                  was the tree.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn70" id="fnref70">70</a></sup>
                  For a Swedenborgian believing that every object in nature is a
                  microcosm of the universe—in Emerson’s words, that “<em>nature is always self-similar</em>”—the projected image and accompanying lecture made immediate
                  for the viewer the sliding scales between small and large that
                  the very production of photographs on glass enacted.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn71" id="fnref71">71</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through the second half of the lecture from 1902, Evans looked
                  at sculptural forms in Lincoln Cathedral that resonated
                  closely with Swedenborgian thought on correspondence with
                  invisible worlds, namely the worlds of angels and devils who
                  communicate with humans. Indeed, Swedenborg’s principal work,
                  <em>Arcana Coelestia</em> (1756), interpreted the Bible
                  through the lens of his own revelatory experiences and
                  conversations with angels. Evans offers three successive views
                  that show the sculptures of the Angel Choir at Lincoln in situ
                  and close-up so that their gleeful expressions and musical
                  instruments can be clearly seen (<a href="#kfiedorek-fig10">fig. 10</a>). A quote from <em>Arcana Coelestia</em> that Evans pasted
                  into the frontispiece of his personal copy of Wilkinson’s
                  <em>The Greater Origins and Issues of Life and Death</em>
                  (1885) describes Swedenborg’s mystical experience of a mob of
                  spirits:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    But in the middle of them I apperceived a sound, soft,
                    angelically sweet, with nothing but what was of order in it.
                    The Angelic Choirs there were within, and the mob of spirits
                    with their disorder was without . . . And it was said that
                    hereby was represented how the Lord rules the ugly and
                    disorderly elements which are outside by a peacemaking in
                    the middle.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn72" id="fnref72">72</a></sup>

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Comparing the actions of angels with the intercession of
                  Christ, Swedenborg becomes conscious of their benevolent

                  Musical instruments were a consistent metaphor for the camera
                  for Evans, who was an enthusiastic pianola player. He defended
                  the self-playing piano as a mechanism that could become more
                  than a “soulless machine” in the hands of an insightful
                  operator, urging that “the full control of its perfect
                  technique is formed by a musicianly spirit, which is
                  equivalent to my photographic doctrine.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn73" id="fnref73">73</a></sup>
                  Like the angels pictured playing string instruments, Evans
                  viewed his role as photographer as one of deriving “soulful”
                  expression from a machine. Moreover, Evans analogizes hearing
                  the inaudible music of angels with seeing the invisible
                  through the photograph: both measure faith in terms of an
                  extrasensory perception.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Angel musicians such as those at Lincoln were first
                  represented in the thirteenth century at exactly the moment
                  when the actual use of musical instruments in church became
                  problematic.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn74" id="fnref74">74</a></sup>
                  Evans’s slides sought to compensate for this past and present
                  soundlessness, replacing music with the visual acuity of the
                  photograph that enables a vision beyond that of the physical
                  eye. His slides made these angels observable in a way that a
                  visit to the site could not; the soaring scale of the
                  cathedral and their position in the triforium made it
                  difficult to see such marginal sculpture from below. In
                  separate slides of the angels, Evans utilized photography’s
                  capacity to enlarge its subject to bring to light the unseen
                  but highly animate forms of the cathedral and to help his
                  audience understand the vital religious sense of the Middle
                  Ages. Paradoxically, the modern technology of the camera
                  enabled a pre-modern vision, a deliberate attentiveness that
                  Evans associates with the medieval in contrast to the
                  incursions and distractions of modernity; the camera’s powers
                  of magnification fostered an appreciation for hidden detail at
                  odds with the “idly-busy life that crowds outside” the
                  cathedral around 1900.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn75" id="fnref75">75</a></sup>
                  The angels and their heavenly music figure the kind of
                  spiritual sight that Evans tries to obtain, an intuition of
                  celestial forms delivered through the senses, whether aural or
                  visual. If angels incarnate the forces of good and the
                  sculptures at Lincoln solidify their spiritual forms, his
                  photographs on glass enhance these layers of embodiment by
                  providing the viewer with a very physical perception of the
                  cathedral’s details through the projected, large-scale image.

                  At the opposite end of the spectrum from angels lies the world
                  of devils. In contrast to the uncritically optimistic
                  relationship to invisible spheres shared by
                  Spiritualists—their spirits are always
                  <em>friendly</em> ghosts—Swedenborg stressed that
                  inter-worldly communication could occur with devils as much as
                  angels. Henry James, Sr., became a lifelong Swedenborgian and
                  friend of Wilkinson’s after one such visitation by a devil in
                  1844; in a further example of the relevance of the diabolical
                  to the Mystic’s belief, the fictional Swedenborgian Rev.
                  Jennings in Sheridan Le Fanu’s story “Green Tea” (1872) cuts
                  his throat with a razor after he opens himself to influx and
                  is terrorized by a demonic monkey.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn76" id="fnref76">76</a></sup>
                  In a final eulogy for the Gothic craftsman, Evans concludes
                  his 1902 lecture on Lincoln Cathedral with what he calls “our
                  specimens of comic relief” in devilish forms spewed from the
                  medieval imagination.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn77" id="fnref77">77</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Grotesques and gargoyles were valuable to Evans and his
                  contemporaries because, in Morris’s words, they were
                  “evidently the work of the ordinary workman”, expressions of
                  his individuality, fantasy, and even subversion of official
                  aesthetic programmes and dogma.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn78" id="fnref78">78</a></sup>
                  The Lincoln Imp, a horned figure that seems to float mid-air
                  in Evans’s high-contrast, extreme close-up, is a pre-eminent
                  example of the enchanting grotesque (<a href="#kfiedorek-fig11">fig. 11</a>). According to popular legend, Satan sent this devil to
                  Earth to cause mayhem and an angel retaliated by turning the
                  imp into stone. Burrowed in the foot of a spandrel in the
                  Angel Choir, the Lincoln Imp is practically invisible, even
                  more so than the angels (<a href="#kfiedorek-fig12">fig. 12</a>).

                  Such grotesques held an important key to the medieval spirit
                  as it was understood at the fin de siècle; as Swedenborg wrote
                  that ancient men had a greater capacity for spiritual vision
                  than their modern counterparts, so Evans discerned this acuity
                  in medieval builders through their fascination with the
                  monstrous. The exhibition catalogue for the Linked Ring salon
                  of 1902 captioned one of Evans’s photographs of a cathedral
                  grotesque with the biblical verse, “They gaped upon me with
                  their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion” (Psalm 22:13),
                  where these terrifying figures simultaneously attract and
                  repel within an Old Testament framework. According to Michael
                  Camille in his study on the margins of medieval art, the
                  intensifying emphasis upon sin and self-reflection in the wake
                  of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) made these primordial
                  beasts instruments of fear wielded by church authorities as
                  much as reflections of the possible perversity of oneself.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn79" id="fnref79">79</a></sup>
                  Late nineteenth-century Decadents like Evans’s protégé Aubrey
                  Beardsley (1872–1898) seized upon this latter aspect,
                  utilizing the gargoyle trope to embody a modern world seeing
                  itself as grotesque while simultaneously aspiring to an
                  earlier imaginative ingenuity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn80" id="fnref80">80</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a famous portrait, Evans pictures Beardsley like a gargoyle
                  perched on the side of a medieval cathedral, his long spindly
                  fingers recalling flying buttresses as they prop up his beaked
                  face (ca. 1894; <a href="#kfiedorek-fig13">fig. 13</a>).
                  Beardsley protrudes from the support of his hands like the
                  grotesque satyrs emerge from a swirling thicket of thorns in
                  his bordering drawing. Years after Evans more or less gave up
                  photography, he remained intrigued by the mystical potential
                  of this ghastliness, publishing
                  <em>Grotesques by Aubrey Beardsley</em> (using this portrait
                  as a frontispiece) with twelve platinum facsimiles from
                  drawings in his personal collection in 1919. Evans saw a
                  lineage of “monstrous ideas and imaginings” extending from
                  Blake, who took an early interest in Swedenborg’s New Church,
                  to Beardsley, whom Evans wrote “confirms Swedenborg to the
                  core”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn81" id="fnref81">81</a></sup>
                  The same year that he wrote his treatise on Swedenborg in
                  1912, Evans published seventeen platinotype reproductions of
                  <em>William Blake’s Illustrations to Thornton’s Pastorals of
                    Virgil</em>
                  (1821). These were not copies, but “enlarged fac-similes” that
                  used photographic enlargement to make Blake’s miniscule
                  original woodcuts (2.54 x 5.71 cm) observable as never before.
                  Evans quoted Wilkinson on Blake at this time:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    His imagination, self-divorced from a reason which might
                    have elevated and chastened it, and necessarily spurning the
                    scientific daylight and material reason of the nineteenth
                    century, found a home in the ruins of ancient and
                    consummated Churches; and imbued itself with the superficial
                    obscurity and ghastliness, far more than the inward grandeur
                    of primeval times . . . the artist yielded himself up more
                    thoroughly than other men <em>will</em> do, to those
                    fantastic impulses which are common to all mankind; and
                    which saner people subjugate, but cannot exterminate.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn82" id="fnref82">82</a></sup>

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Evans himself explicitly connected Blake and Beardsley’s
                  “dreadful pictures” to Swedenborg’s doctrine of vastation,
                  which literally means a laying waste or emptying out of evil
                  qualities that animated his own practice in photography on
                  glass.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn83" id="fnref83">83</a></sup>

                  The theory of vastation gives a new gloss to Evans’s storied
                  preoccupation with purism, given that he approached the
                  lantern slide as a medium that purged the photograph of
                  potential duplicity. While on the one hand a marker of the
                  Stieglitzian strain of Pictorialist practice, the purist
                  character of his photographs also embodied his desire to
                  unlearn the troubling mediations of modern vision and to
                  exhume a primary spiritual sight as described by Swedenborg—a
                  connection between “straight” photography and faith that would
                  reach its pinnacle in Paul Strand’s seminal essay,
                  “Photography and the New God” (1922).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn84" id="fnref84">84</a></sup>
                  Wilkinson called this Swedenborg’s “ocular honesty” and
                  posited that it allowed him to perceive “communicated Divine
                  Experiences”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn85" id="fnref85">85</a></sup>
                  At Lincoln Cathedral, Evans mapped this purism onto the
                  architecture itself.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn86" id="fnref86">86</a></sup>
                  In an early slide of the West Front View, he calls attention
                  to how the building is a palimpsest of various styles that are
                  “without structural unity”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn87" id="fnref87">87</a></sup>
                  The restoration of its jambs in 1860 was “a sheer imitation, a
                  lie”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn88" id="fnref88">88</a></sup>
                  Just as he condemned manipulated and retouched photographs, he
                  abhorred architectural restorations that passed themselves off
                  as genuine.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The sacred location made the work of the “restoration fiend”
                  even more “criminal”: “certainly one would look for the
                  keenest and purest evidence of truth in a building devoted to
                  the worship of God!”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn89" id="fnref89">89</a></sup>
                  Evans similarly points out the restoration of the pillars of
                  the North Aisle, arguing that before-and-after views can be
                  correctives to such inauthenticity—photographs can actually
                  purify the falsifications of the buildings. What Evans reads
                  as fraudulence in the cathedral, shadowed as the potential
                  misrepresentation of a doctored photograph, is precluded in
                  his mind by the lantern slide format. Due to the nature of its
                  enlargement of the photographic image, the lantern slide
                  discriminated against the darkroom tricks that Evans called
                  “heresies” by magnifying what might be imperceptible on
                  paper.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn90" id="fnref90">90</a></sup>
                  In one of his many articles on photography on glass, Evans
                  warned would-be manipulators: “Be sure your sin will find you
                  out.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn91" id="fnref91">91</a></sup>
                  His lantern slides helped eliminate the barriers to an
                  “honest” vision, and the sacred building thus became a way of
                  figuring purity in photography.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Evans’s preoccupation with the grotesque was a way for him to
                  conceptualize vastation, where forms that were by turn comic
                  and terrifying stimulate the regeneration of perception as
                  described by Swedenborg. As such, his photographs of
                  grotesques catalyze the kind of incisive vision he compels his
                  audience to learn throughout his lecture on Lincoln Cathedral.
                  Understanding salvation as a progressive regeneration, Evans
                  ended his talk with these images as a way of preparing viewers
                  to leave the lecture hall with both a finer appreciation of
                  the medieval building and renewed perceptual faculties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The defining aspects of Evans’s practice—purism,
                  craftsmanship, attention to the metaphysical qualities of
                  light, as well as the angelic and diabolical undercurrents of
                  existence—reclaim “the feeling of past greatness” that Evans
                  perceived in his jointly spiritual and aesthetic study of
                  places of worship. At the same time as photography on glass
                  offered the promise of transcending the natural world to
                  discern its latent spiritual plane, Evans understood that such
                  an attempt must necessarily be rooted in the material. In his
                  biography of Wilkinson, Evans quoted him challenging the
                  Swedenborgian notion that outer or “ultimate” forms are “less
                  living” than interior forms: “It is wrong, therefore, to
                  attempt to transcend the fact of embodiment; the hope is
                  mistaken that would lead us to endeavor thus after pure
                  spirituality.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn92" id="fnref92">92</a></sup>
                  Evans used his lantern slides of cathedrals as the materials
                  to embody Swedenborgian mystical experience, and his lectures
                  put into practice the tenet of modelling a viewer more open to
                  influx. Evans’s photographs of English cathedrals, this
                  article has argued, are most fully comprehended when his
                  preference for glass over paper as a support for images is
                  acknowledged and interpreted through his affiliation to
                  Swedenborgianism.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Towards the end of Evans’s extended essay on Swedenborg, he
                  praises H. G. Wells’s “magically fine story”, “The Door in the
                  Wall”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn93" id="fnref93">93</a></sup>
                  In this widely read story from 1911, a mysterious door leading
                  to an enchanted garden periodically tempts the protagonist
                  Wallace, who defers from opening it until dissatisfaction with
                  worldly success as a politician finally drives him to do so
                  and he tumbles to his death. In a similar fashion, Evans’s
                  photographs implicitly question what would happen were it
                  possible to chase down their fugitive light or to gain the
                  immediacy of vision they endorse. Evans’s admiration for what
                  he called the “aching glimpses” of this story suggests that
                  for him as for many of his contemporaries, “pure spirituality”
                  was a moving target. Doubt about what lay behind the closed
                  door was an integral component of the longing to open it,
                  illuminating how faith was ultimately based on fragmentary
                  spiritual insights rather than sure and certain proof. His
                  photographs were aching glimpses of a sacred energy felt to
                  have dissipated in the early twentieth century. Displayed as
                  lantern slides, they were both necessarily partial views of a
                  bygone magic and paradigms of its continuity in Edwardian
                  culture.

                        Scholarship has focused almost exclusively on Evans’s
                        platinum prints, beginning with the first monograph
                        dedicated to the photographer by Beaumont Newhall in
                        1964 and extending to more recent studies. When
                        mentioned at all, the lantern slides most often
                        reproduced are his early scientific photomicrographs.
                        For the most current critical discussion of Evans’s
                        career, see Anne Lyden,
                        <em>The Photographs of Frederick H. Evans</em> (Los
                        Angeles: The J. Paul Getty Museum, 2010). One notable
                        exception is the groundbreaking work of Anne Hammond,
                        who has made significant strides in shedding new light
                        on other, “commercial” formats pursued by Evans,
                        particularly in his photographs of English country
                        church interiors commissioned to illustrate articles in
                        the magazine <em>Country Life</em> in 1905. Though this
                        was a commercial engagement, Hammond stresses that Evans
                        had complete control of his subject matter. See Anne

                        argued that Evans’s most famous print of Wells Cathedral
                        takes religion not just as a subject but also as a model
                        of conversion to an aesthetic appreciation of life. See

                        In its attention to the materiality of the photograph,
                        this essay follows scholars who have looked with renewed
                        attention to the original physical contexts of
                        nineteenth-century photographs to understand how their

                        Like an increasing number of his contemporaries, Evans
                        saw no incompatibility between his mystical leanings and
                        identifying as a proper Protestant who accepted the
                        authority of Christ. Böhme was central in introducing a
                        mystical vocabulary from the Continent into England when
                        John Sparrow and John Ellistone translated his works
                        into English in the 1640s. Though his hero William Blake
                        was equally interested in Böhme and Swedenborg, Evans
                        wrote much more extensively on the latter mystic. See
                        Robert Rix,
                        <em>William Blake and the Cultures of Radical

                        It is unknown where Evans delivered this particular
                        lecture, for which full lecture notes are extant.
                        However, he gave other lectures on Lincoln Cathedral to
                        the London Camera Club in 1896 and the Royal
                        Photographic Society in 1899, as well as a slide lecture
                        on Ely Cathedral to the Camera Club in 1897.
                        Conceivably, this was given to an audience of
                        photographers as well.

                        Catholic churches in late nineteenth- and early

                        Evans may even have been sympathetic to his atheist

                        initiated the formation of a new denomination based on
                        his theories, but late eighteenth-century English
                        radicals established the Church of the New Jerusalem in
                        1789, which counted Blake as an early member. Many if
                        not most committed Swedenborgians, including Wilkinson
                        and Evans, were never officially baptized into this
                        Church.

                        Early subjects for lantern slides also included
                        landscape views of the English countryside, close-ups of
                        objects like a Japanese sword-guard, and studies of
                        William Morris’s house, Kelmscott Manor. These seem to
                        have been less celebrated than his scientific images.

                        In Swedenborg’s theory of correspondences, matter,
                        rather than condemned as secondary or derivative of the
                        divine, serves as the means by which the divine can be
                        expressed. See, for example, Swedenborg,
                        <em>Arcana Coelestia</em>, 5711: “Nothing can exist
                        anywhere in the material world that does not have a
                        correspondence with the spiritual world—because if it
                        did, it would have no cause that would make it come into
                        being and then allow it to continue in existence.
                        Everything in the material world is an effect. The
                        causes of all effects lie in the spiritual world, and
                        the causes of those causes in turn (which are the
                        purposes those causes serve) lie in a still deeper
                        heaven.”

                        Mumler in the United States and Jean Buguet in France
                        were prosecuted for fraud in 1869 and 1875,
                        respectively, in highly publicized trials. The similarly
                        eminent spirit photographer Frederick Hudson of London
                        faced no legal action during his career. This helps
                        substantiate Rolf H. Krauss’s claim that mediumistic
                        photography began in America but henceforth belonged
                        almost entirely to the Anglo-Saxon world, especially
                        England. See Krauss,

                        The term “photism”, which only appeared as the German
                        “Photisma” in 1881, was used by James to describe the
                        blinding luminous phenomena of conversions experienced
                        by prophets like St Paul in
                        <em>Varieties of Religious Experience</em>, 251. In
                        footnote 21, page 253, James addresses how reports of
                        sensorial (that is, physical) photism can shade off into
                        metaphorical accounts of a new sense of spiritual
                        illumination. Moreover, he acknowledges his debt to
                        psychologists for this word, and indeed it appears

                        Proust seems to have held onto the formative idea from
                        his childhood that photographs are characterized by
                        their “commercial banality”: they lack the “thicknesses”
                        of other media so that they need to be filtered through
                        other mediations (e.g. his mother prefers that he look
                        at a photograph of Corot’s painting of Chartres to a
                        photograph of Chartres in <em>Swann’s Way</em>, 45–46).
                        Later in the first volume, Proust describes a scene of
                        iconoclasm where Mlle Vinteuil dares her lover to spit
                        on a photograph of her father, which by profaning the
                        photograph reveals its latent power. For the growing

                        Cambridge Camden Society had built chancels for the
                        choir since the 1840s, altering Protestant worship by
                        separating laity and clergy.

                        Morris was agnostic, which was not so unconventional by
                        the time of his death in 1898, but his reasoning
                        (essentially, that if God existed, he would not leave it
                        a mystery) was idiosyncratic. His lifelong project to
                        resuscitate medieval aesthetics suggests that he
                        believed in the value of religious ritual though not
                        doctrine. See John Hollow, “William Morris and the

                  This article’s aims are twofold: firstly, it argues that
                  Prunella Clough’s engagement with consumer items in her
                  paintings of the 1980s and 1990s constitute a sustained
                  engagement with the fluctuating nature of the commodity form,
                  moving beyond the established critical narrative whereby these
                  works are understood as simply redeeming “everyday” materials.
                  Secondly, in order to do this, it proposes new artistic
                  frameworks for Clough’s work, moving away from her early
                  association with Neo-Romanticism to foreground her
                  relationship with Pop and Minimalism, and with Post-Conceptual
                  painting. Clough’s late works, it finds, powerfully condense
                  histories of industrial production and painting in Britain.

                <p>
                  During the 1980s and 1990s, in the last two decades of a
                  career that began in the 1940s, the painter Prunella Clough
                  embarked on a distinct phase within her work. The first part
                  of Clough’s oeuvre saw her create studies of dockworkers at
                  Lowestoft harbour, and labourers in factories tending their
                  machines. These were followed by industrial landscapes that
                  became progressively more abstract throughout the 1960s and
                  1970s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>&nbsp;By the mid-1980s, however, Clough had shifted her attention
                  away from the chemical works, gravel pits, and electrical
                  plants that occupied her for many years, and onto small, cheap
                  consumer items that she glimpsed for sale in London corner
                  shops and markets, and on souvenir stalls at decaying seaside
                  resorts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;The abstracted images Clough developed from her studies of
                  these commodities constitute a unique episode in the artist’s
                  sustained meditation on the gradual movement from an
                  industrial to a post-industrial economy in Britain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Clough’s first public presentation of this new subject matter
                  occurred in 1989, with her first exhibition at the Annely Juda
                  Fine Art Gallery in London.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>&nbsp;The titles of works included in
                  <em>Prunella Clough: Recent Paintings, 1980–1989</em> signal
                  Clough’s concern by this point with the synthetic, packaged,
                  and mass produced: <em>Wrapper</em> (1985),
                  <em>Iridescent</em> (1987), <em>Sugar Hearts</em> (1987),
                  <em>Toypack: Sword</em> (1988), <em>Sweetpack</em> (1988),
                  <em>Vacuum Pack</em> (1988), <em>Plastic Bag</em> (1988), and
                  <em>Party Pack</em> (1989). Clough had already undertaken one
                  substantial solo show that decade with an exhibition in 1982
                  at the Warwick Arts Trust, but this was dominated by the very
                  different agendas of her <em>Gate</em> and
                  <em>Subway</em> series.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>&nbsp;While the catalogue for the 1982 show contained an
                  introduction and rare interview with the artist by the curator
                  Bryan Robertson, the depth of the painter-critic Patrick
                  Heron’s essay accompanying the exhibition of 1989 confirmed it
                  as a significant departure.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  The result was a critical and financial success.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>&nbsp;It catalyzed Clough’s upward trajectory in Britain over the
                  following decade, which saw her embark on major exhibitions at
                  the Camden Arts Centre in London (1996) and Kettle’s Yard Art
                  Gallery, Cambridge (1999).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>&nbsp;Shortly before her death in 1999, Clough received the
                  prestigious Jerwood Painting Prize.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>&nbsp;The Annely Juda exhibition marked an important juncture in
                  terms of Clough’s professional visibility, as well as the
                  formal and conceptual stakes of her painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Critics responded enthusiastically to Clough’s engagement with
                  the often-discarded fragments of advanced capitalism. In his
                  catalogue essay, Heron observed that Clough was “fascinated .
                  . . by many of those products of the present age whose magical
                  potential she alone has perceived and in her paintings has
                  insisted on celebrating”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>&nbsp;The wider critical reception of these works elaborated the
                  implications of Heron’s analysis, with the critic Tim Hilton
                  stating that each of Clough’s paintings presents “a singular
                  representation of a trivial object that, by reason of its
                  existence in a serious modern painting, acquires an
                  ontological aura”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>&nbsp;This perspective infuses reviews of Clough’s other
                  exhibitions, which similarly stress the “redemptive impulse”
                  of her work, leading to the characterization of Clough’s later
                  paintings as primarily concerned with the metamorphosis of the
                  everyday.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>&nbsp;By contrast, this essay seeks to complicate the established
                  trope that Clough’s works from the 1980s and 1990s comprise
                  acts of metaphorical, and for some commentators rather
                  whimsical, salvage. Clough’s exploration of commodity life
                  cycles is by no means unconnected with an interrogation of
                  painterly process, but the ecologies established by her
                  treatment of abstraction are far more nuanced than the
                  straightforward transformation of “low” culture into “high”
                  art.

                <p>
                  Rather, Clough’s paintings of the 1980s and 1990s instigate an
                  extended investigation of the commodity form. The art
                  historian Margaret Garlake describes how Clough’s later works
                  “take an ironic look at a culture which has moved during her
                  working life from austerity to satiety, in which industry is
                  as much concerned with the production of instant rubbish as
                  with the essentials of existence”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>&nbsp;Yet Clough’s cognizance of waste constantly undercuts
                  apparent affluence with the shadow of boom and bust. As Andy
                  Beckett observes in his history of Britain during the 1970s,
                  “from 1945 onwards, the issue of Britain’s decline changed
                  from a matter for intermittent public debate into a major and
                  growing preoccupation of political life.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>&nbsp;This anxiety stemmed from the fact that “between 1950 and
                  1970, the country’s share of the world’s manufacturing exports
                  shrank from over a quarter to barely a tenth.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>&nbsp;The movement from an export to an import economy was linked
                  to the rise of the service sector, the outsourcing of labour
                  overseas, and the globalized circulation of inexpensive
                  consumer merchandise. Clough’s studies of mass-produced items
                  register these developments, while acknowledging the rapidity
                  with which desirable commodities might become unwanted under
                  the pressures of overproduction and designed obsolescence.
                  Indeed, Clough’s approach to the commodity evokes Karl Marx’s
                  famous description of it in volume one of
                  <em>Capital</em> (1867) as “a very queer thing indeed, full of
                  metaphysical subtleties and theological whimsies”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>&nbsp;An awareness of the commodity’s fluctuating nature, and the
                  ramifications of this for painting as a practice, threads
                  throughout Clough’s work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The aims of this essay are twofold. In order to
                  reconceptualize Clough’s late paintings as explorations of
                  commodity relations, it proposes in tandem alternative
                  artistic frameworks for considering Clough’s work, prising her
                  away from an early and surprisingly enduring association with
                  Neo-Romanticism, which Heron condemned as a “totally incorrect
                  (and . . . damaging) misconception”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough’s treatment of consumer products can in the first
                  instance be linked to the advent of Pop and Minimalism during
                  the 1960s. Moreover, later debates about the so-called “death
                  of painting”, followed by Post-Conceptual painting, provide
                  suggestive contexts for her work. In the 1950s and 1960s
                  painting enjoyed a pre-eminent position within the British,
                  European, and North American art worlds Clough moved in, but
                  she felt that the discipline subsequently entered something of
                  a wilderness: “In the 1970s, ‘nobody was doing painting’.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>&nbsp;The 1970s saw a diversification of artistic practices in
                  Britain, and an embrace of alternative modes like Conceptual
                  art and performance; according to John A. Walker in his
                  history of this period, “painting and sculpture were
                  experiencing [an] identity crisis”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>&nbsp;This paralleled, and sometimes emerged directly from,
                  conditions created by an economic downturn that saw strikes
                  and fuel shortages.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>&nbsp;Although Clough exhibited fairly regularly in the 1970s, the
                  decade’s reverberations can be detected in the works she
                  created in the 1980s and 1990s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Focusing on paintings that Clough displayed in 1989 at Annely
                  Juda, the first part of this essay situates the preoccupations
                  of Clough’s later work in relation to Pop and Minimalism,
                  while the second shows how still life provided a fertile genre
                  for addressing consumption and the history of
                  industrialization. The final section argues that the
                  understanding of the commodity form developed in response to
                  these models shaped Clough’s interest in recycling through
                  citation and collage. Such strategies in turn correspond to
                  the re-emergence of painting after Conceptualism in the 1980s
                  and 1990s. Rather than painting’s exhaustion, we find in
                  Clough’s late canvases what this essay identifies as ecologies
                  of abstraction. Clough’s tendency to transplant and reuse
                  forms and compositional devices from earlier works, alongside
                  her experimentation with collage and found objects,
                  establishes a network of interlinked, even organic references
                  at the level of representation. Through this network, Clough’s
                  paintings participate in a system of wastage and renewal, in
                  which abstraction functions as a signifier for change and
                  adaptation. By re-thinking Clough’s work in this way, the
                  essay gestures towards a wider re-assessment of the traffic
                  between painting in Britain since the 1980s and its longer
                  histories.

                  The works that Clough showed in 1989 with titles like
                  <em>Sweetpack</em>, <em>Plastic Bag</em>, and
                  <em>Sugar Hearts</em> were, Hilton observed, full of “cheap
                  and ridiculous plastic goods . . . little bits of moulded
                  inconsequence, hairgrips, imitation jewellery, balloons, bags,
                  sweet wrappers and stickers”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup>&nbsp;The sources for these subjects can be found in Clough’s
                  photographic archive. Clough claimed in her 1982 interview
                  with Robertson, “I occasionally take rough photos, but often
                  do not refer to them; they are only approximate aids for the
                  memory.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">22</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough’s papers tell a slightly different story. They
                  contain several series of neatly packaged photographs, dating
                  back to the 1940s but increasing in number during the 1980s
                  and 1990s. Leafing through these snapshots, which Clough’s
                  friend Robin Banks describes as “rough and tough, visionary
                  and sometimes cropped badly or squint”, reveals how her eye
                  snagged repeatedly on certain clusters of objects.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">23</a></sup>&nbsp;Favourite subjects include stacks of brightly coloured
                  plastic chairs, buckets and domestic goods slotted together
                  into conglomerate forms (<a href="#cspencer-fig1">fig. 1</a>);
                  sunglasses and hairclips arrayed in serried ranks on display
                  cards (<a href="#cspencer-fig2">fig. 2</a>); and footballs
                  cocooned in semi-transparent plastic, rendering them
                  mysterious. One particularly suggestive image shows a vending
                  machine full of plastic capsules, each of which contains a
                  small trinket promising a surprise, but veiled and obfuscated
                  (<a href="#cspencer-fig3">fig. 3</a>).

                  Sacha Craddock notes that “Clough uses photographs and to some
                  extent mimics the photographic view”, and the cropped,
                  close-up perspective employed by her canvases replicates the
                  seemingly casual aesthetic of the quick snapshot.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">24</a></sup>&nbsp;The distance insinuated and then marked by the camera lens,
                  through its act of mediation, underscores Clough’s interest in
                  transposition and change. Alongside her photographs, Clough
                  made detailed written notes, such as those in a notebook dated
                  to 1987: “‘Toiletries’ in spangle pale lime green &amp;
                  ‘silver’”, “Shellsuit violet / sand / turquoise” and “airless
                  squashed balloons / pink, yellow, green on / wet pavement (4)
                  / with damp patch”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">25</a></sup>&nbsp;These appear alongside rapid sketches of mirrors, toy
                  windmills, and shapes that have already passed beyond
                  recognizability (<a href="#cspencer-fig4">fig. 4</a>). The
                  notes and photographs unfold Clough’s attraction to ersatz
                  materials, and with those that might be used for camouflage
                  and dissimulation in urban life. It is not simply the case
                  that Clough “metamorphoses” these objects, but that she
                  recognizes their inherently unstable physical character, which
                  simultaneously results from, and comes to stand as an analogue
                  for, their mutable use and exchange value.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">26</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This instability inflects even the most ostensibly
                  decipherable imagery in the paintings Clough showed during
                  1989, such as the central motif of
                  <em>Toypack: Sword</em> (1988;
                  <a href="#cspencer-fig5">fig. 5</a>). In the version of this
                  work reproduced in the Annely Juda catalogue, Clough presents
                  a highly stylized, plastic-looking weapon, its hilt coloured
                  sky blue and sherbet orange.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">27</a></sup>&nbsp;The sword floats against a backdrop composed of
                  unidentifiable, abstract fragments, like the delicate
                  machinery of a watch scattered across a white field (nothing
                  as substantial as “ground” is offered here). For Hilton,
                  Clough depicts her central image “with just enough realism for
                  one to be able to grasp that here is a toy”; this is the kind
                  of frippery that could be picked up cheaply in a store selling
                  mass-produced consumer items, and used to beguile a child for
                  a few hours.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">28</a></sup>&nbsp;The neologism of Clough’s title stresses the point:
                  “Toypack” indicates that this sword is part of a “pack”, one
                  of many identical cellophane-wrapped items.

                <p>
                  The viewer of Clough’s paintings from the 1980s encounters
                  commodity items at a slightly different stage in their life
                  cycle to the celebration of newly minted goods in many Pop
                  canvases of the 1960s. In <em>Toypack: Sword</em> an air of
                  abandonment cuts against the toy’s pastel shades. Yet although
                  Clough’s paintings have rarely been aligned with developments
                  of the 1960s, she nonetheless recalled this period as
                  especially generative, admitting “there were many difficulties
                  in the Sixties which were also a pleasure and an
                  exhilaration.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">29</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough kept abreast of occurrences in the United States,
                  visiting New York and attending a variety of shows by American
                  artists in Britain, such as Robert Rauschenberg’s exhibition
                  at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1964, and Roy Lichtenstein’s
                  Tate show of 1968.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">30</a></sup>&nbsp;<em>Toypack: Sword</em> registers the legacies of Pop,
                  albeit at a determined move, not simply in terms of its
                  engagement with the commodity form, but in the way that the
                  painting explicitly, almost jarringly, overlays representation
                  onto abstraction, and in so doing fundamentally dislocates the
                  co-ordinates of both.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Reflecting on Clough’s career in the 1990s, Hilton observed:
                  “I think she feels gratitude for the Sixties: not the
                  fashionable or pop side of the decade but the way that
                  painters kept putting new abstract ideas in the arena.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">31</a></sup>&nbsp;While suggestive, this statement ignores the role that
                  abstraction played within Pop, particularly the strand of
                  visual experimentation in Britain that coalesced around
                  artists like Richard Smith and Robyn Denny.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">32</a></sup>&nbsp;Furthermore, Hal Foster proposes that much Pop art is not
                  easily resolvable as figurative or even realist in any
                  meaningful sense: “Pop does not return art, after the
                  difficulties of abstraction, to the verities of
                  representation; rather, it combines the two categories in a
                  simulacral mode that not only differs from both but disturbs
                  them as well.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">33</a></sup>&nbsp;The navigation of abstraction and realism is a consistent
                  aspect of Clough’s work, but it comes into sharp focus in her
                  studies of toys and product packaging during the 1980s.

                  Equally, while Clough did not associate directly with Pop
                  artists, she was familiar with the eminently fashionable 1960s
                  phenomenon of Op art through her friendship with the painter
                  Bridget Riley.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">34</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough’s work provided a significant precedent for the
                  younger artist. On encountering her work in 1953 at the
                  Leicester Galleries, Riley recognized Clough as “unmistakably
                  a modern painter”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">35</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough’s later paintings playfully return to the visual
                  language of the 1960s. In <em>Emerge</em> (1996) Clough has
                  overlaid several sections of black-and-white vertical lines
                  within a scuffed surround, recalling Riley’s signature Op art
                  images such as <em>Fall</em> (1963) and
                  <em>Current</em> (1964). <em>Emerge</em> references both
                  Riley’s pared down abstract striations and the perceptual
                  flicker they establish, akin to the disruptive ripple of
                  migraine aura (<a href="#cspencer-fig6">fig. 6</a>). The edges
                  of Clough’s striped sections do not quite match up, triggering
                  the impression of movement and recession intimated by the
                  painting’s title. Clough’s citation of Riley, however, is
                  fully embedded within her own mode of working. Testifying to
                  her predilection for “beaten up” canvases, in places the
                  intersecting planes dissolve under a corrosive stain, their
                  edges inexpertly sutured together.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">36</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Minimalist abstraction, however, clearly exerted a particular
                  pull.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">37</a></sup>&nbsp;The productive challenges posed by the 1960s encompassed
                  “the first sight of Donald Judd and Sol Lewitt, for instance,
                  and minimalism. The ideas were of a kind that were
                  incompatible with the European tradition that I grew up
                  with.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">38</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough also admired the work of the US painter Myron Stout,
                  who created radically simplified black-and-white canvases
                  dominated by single shapes. The British artist Rachel
                  Whiteread recognized the intersections between Clough’s work
                  and Minimalism, writing that she could “draw parallels”
                  between her Postminimalist sculpture and Clough’s
                  paintings.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">39</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough’s reference to Judd is particularly suggestive,
                  however, given his use of seriality and modular repetition,
                  modes which can be indexed to the forms and processes of the
                  postmodern, service-oriented, white-collar city.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">40</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Clough’s photographic archive demonstrates the importance of
                  repetition and replication for her later practice, but this
                  equally informs her use of other media. Clough was an
                  accomplished printmaker, accustomed to making multiple
                  iterations of the same image.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">41</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough also constructed assemblages from mass-produced items
                  amassed on walks through urban and industrial environments,
                  including “old work gloves, wire mesh, pieces of rusting
                  metal, a plastic toy sword, fragments of Formica, a shard of
                  coloured pottery or a steam-rolled tin can”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">42</a></sup>&nbsp;Ian Barker recounts that the discovery of reliefs made from
                  these objects in Clough’s studio after her death came as “a
                  total surprise”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">43</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough nonetheless considered them part of her practice, as
                  “on their reverse were Prunella’s carefully typed
                  labels—identical to those she used to identify her paintings
                  and drawings.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">44</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough exhibited an assemblage only once during her
                  lifetime, at Annely Juda in 1989, emphasizing the correlations
                  between her found object reliefs and the paintings in the
                  show.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">45</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  One assemblage, entitled <em>Equivalence</em> (1965), offers a
                  response to the provocations of the 1960s (<a href="#cspencer-fig7">fig. 7</a>). Its white segments, nailed onto a synthetic mint-green
                  background, look like the modular parts of a child’s
                  construction kit wrenched from their original purpose.
                  Clough’s use of plastic in this assemblage partakes in the
                  artistic experimentation with new, prefabricated materials by
                  practitioners associated with Pop and Minimalism. The abstract
                  <em>Equivalence</em> proposed here is qualified. The white
                  shapes either side of the central black partition seem like
                  they could match up, but on closer inspection their number and
                  distribution do not correspond. Similarly,
                  <em>Toypack: Sword</em> offers a questionable equivalence. The
                  painting presents the viewer with a depiction of a dagger that
                  revels in its status of second-order representation, to the
                  extent that its hovering form starts to seem like a simulacrum
                  set adrift from a tangible referent. This inference migrates
                  across Clough’s work from the 1980s and 1990s, stemming from
                  the commodity’s paradoxical combination of materiality and
                  abstracted labour power.

                <p>
                  This slipperiness can be tracked back through Clough’s
                  thinking about commodities from the outset of her career.
                  During the 1950s, when Clough was still focused on landscape
                  studies of factories, chemical works, and power stations, she
                  and the painter David Carr exchanged a rich correspondence
                  about these zones of production.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">46</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough never explicitly critiqued commodity production,
                  stating dispassionately to Carr: “The fact that a lorry is
                  loaded by a crane with a crate of useless objects and driven
                  to some place where nobody wants them seems just an aspect of
                  human stupidity which is so constant that one can hardly get
                  upset about it.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">47</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough developed her thoughts on the nature of objects
                  useful and useless in other missives, notably during an
                  extended account of a trip to a paint factory. Clough immersed
                  herself in the details of the site, with its “vats of
                  chemicals, drying powder, paste paint, boiling oil, resins,
                  tanks, roller grinders, millstone grinders, ball grinders,
                  distemper mixers, sheet-tin can makers, spot welders”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">48</a></sup>&nbsp;It is, however, the following passage that proves
                  particularly revealing in terms of Clough’s conceptualization
                  of production:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Men painty [sic] from head to foot, women putting on can
                    handles without looking; and the transition—to simplicity,
                    speed and visual boredom in the new “experimental” machines,
                    the closed constructions where raw material is fed in and
                    emerges a product, invisible, mysterious—whereas the others
                    were open, explicit, logical.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">49</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  In the space of a sentence, Clough maps a seismic change from
                  earlier modes of manufacture. Where machines were once “open,
                  explicit, logical”, what she observes occurring in the new
                  “experimental” factories is akin to alchemy, whereby the
                  materials are put in, and the “product” emerges through
                  unknowable processes. While humans attend to this
                  transformation, the hand-made has been truly usurped by
                  complex machinery, which has assumed total responsibility for
                  the creation of goods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is as if Clough savoured this observation in order to apply
                  it later in <em>Toypack: Sword</em>. The sword drifts over
                  splinters of raw matter, replicating the sudden jump from
                  inchoate material to final “product” observed by Clough at the
                  paint factory. Its chemical colouring emphasizes that this is
                  a plastic toy, recalling Roland Barthes’s evocation of
                  plastic’s creation: “At one end, raw, telluric matter, at the
                  other, the finished, human object. . . . More than a
                  substance, plastic is the very idea of its infinite
                  transformation; as its everyday name indicates, it is ubiquity
                  made visible.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">50</a></sup>&nbsp;The plastic items that Clough photographed, and then
                  filtered through abstraction into works like
                  <em>Toypack: Sword</em>, mark an intensification of the
                  material’s restless movement. By the 1980s, the production of
                  budget plastic toys, accessories, and cleaning utensils had
                  largely been outsourced from Britain to other countries, and
                  the physical evidence of industrial production receded from
                  the landscape. It is also tempting to read
                  <em>Toypack: Sword</em> as an analogy for the act of painting
                  and its transpositions, which in light of Clough’s captivation
                  by the factory production of paint, simultaneously
                  acknowledges the commodity status of the resulting work.
                  Considering Clough’s work in relation to Pop and Minimalism,
                  even if she ultimately kept both at a distance, enables the
                  full extent of her work’s imbrication in cycles of mass
                  production, industrialization, and consumption to emerge.

                  In the list of paintings for Clough’s Annely Juda exhibition
                  of 1989, one category impresses through its multiple
                  recurrences: that of the still life. Of thirty-eight works in
                  the show, six were specifically titled “still life”. In his
                  essay, Heron alights on this aspect of Clough’s most “recent
                  paintings”, which “are actually entitled
                  <em>Still Life</em> or *Interior—*not that they can for a
                  moment be thought of as continuing any tradition of spatial
                  reconstruction of inhabitable domestic space”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">51</a></sup>&nbsp;Nevertheless, Heron felt, the paintings “seem to be
                  projecting at us a spatial reality that implies those almost
                  claustrophobic, limited sequences of depth which constitute
                  the experience of the ‘still life’ or the ‘interior’”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">52</a></sup>&nbsp;This engagement with still life replays Pop art’s obsession
                  with domestic products, and with the commodity fetishism
                  invested in household goods, again indicating the importance
                  of the artistic frameworks established in the first section of
                  this essay for Clough’s practice.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53">53</a></sup>&nbsp;It moreover ties into longer traditions of the still life
                  from the Dutch seventeenth century onwards, and, in Clough’s
                  hands, with histories of commodity production in Britain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Heron connected Clough’s interest in still life to her regard
                  for the French artist Georges Braque’s Cubist experiments.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54">54</a></sup>&nbsp;He compared Clough’s enthusiasm for “mass-produced objects,
                  manufactured to meet popular tastes” to “the crude and
                  patently ‘suburban’ furnishings of small cafés near
                  Varengeville [that] inspired many of Braque’s most exquisitely
                  classical pictorial inventions”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55">55</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough’s use of the still life genre to reflect on
                  mass-produced commodity items can be rooted in Modernist
                  pathways to abstraction.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56">56</a></sup>&nbsp;It relates to a particular strand of Modernism that engaged
                  with the everyday and the quotidian, the material effects of
                  bourgeois living, and the impact of manufacturing and industry
                  on popular culture.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57">57</a></sup>&nbsp;Yet, as Heron intimates, Clough’s still lifes diverge from
                  these models, as they do not deliver the viewer into
                  “inhabitable domestic space”, but rather a disorientating and
                  unstable topography.
                </p>

                  These qualities can be discerned in many works Clough showed
                  in 1989, notably <em>Still Life</em> (1987). At just over a
                  metre high, it dominates the viewer’s visual field. A
                  synthetically coloured green oval, shimmering with hints of
                  oil-slick iridescence, hangs amidst a constellation of white
                  dots on a black background as if suspended in a
                  sediment-filled solution (<a href="#cspencer-fig8">fig. 8</a>). A transparent penumbra unfurls around its central nucleus
                  like a watermark, or cloud of gas. Heron described
                  <em>Still Life</em> as a painting of “electrifying
                  strangeness”, its queasy combination of diagrammatic flatness
                  and shallow depth resisting coherent and identifiable
                  representation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58">58</a></sup>&nbsp;Certain details, however, offer associative possibilities.
                  The central shape mimics the opaque capsules containing small
                  toys in the vending machine photographed by Clough. The
                  umbilical loop of cord or rubber hosing protruding into the
                  top of the painting, partially obscured by a rectangular
                  scrim, has affinities with a drawing Clough made in her 1987
                  notebook, glossed as a “sk rope” (presumably “skipping rope”)
                  (<a href="#cspencer-fig9">fig. 9</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59">59</a></sup>&nbsp;The colours echo those Clough deployed in contemporaneous
                  works like <em>Sweetpack</em>, also included in the show,
                  redolent of glistering confectionary wrappings. While visually
                  alluring, this palette’s evocation of oil on water alludes to
                  the petrochemicals used to make plastic, so that like
                  <em>Toypack: Sword</em> it evokes chains of commodity
                  production.

                  Annely Juda insisted that Clough’s earlier work “was very
                  important to understand what she was doing later on”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60">60</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough’s consistent commitment to still life exemplifies
                  this. In a review of Clough’s Leicester Galleries exhibition
                  in London of 1953, the critic and painter John Berger claimed:
                  “The key to understanding Miss Clough’s work is to realise
                  that she is fundamentally a still-life painter. Above all, she
                  is interested in the material, the density, the tactile ‘feel’
                  of the objects she paints.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61">61</a></sup>&nbsp;During the 1940s, Clough did produce conventional still
                  lifes of fruit, flowers, and shell arrangements.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn62" id="fnref62">62</a></sup>&nbsp;In <em>Still Life with Yellow Marrows</em> (1948) four
                  yellow courgette blossoms, framed by a wicker basket, glow
                  softly against a dingy brown-black background. Garlake notes
                  that during the 1940s, when Clough’s career began, “still life
                  was a simple subject demanding no more than a few vegetables
                  or household objects, a favoured genre during the war when
                  artists often spent long periods without studios or access to
                  models.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn63" id="fnref63">63</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough herself enjoyed “the sort of paintings that . . . are
                  intensive rather than extensive . . . early Giacometti, early
                  Morandi, early de Chirico even. They all have to do, in
                  varying ways, with still life.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn64" id="fnref64">64</a></sup>&nbsp;The title of Berger’s review—“Machine-Life
                  Painting”—indicates, however, that the subject matter of
                  Clough’s still lifes was not that of the bourgeois home.

                  Instead, Berger states, the “machine lifes” of the 1953 show,
                  with titles like <em>Night Train Landscape</em>, <em>The</em>
                  <em>Cranes</em>, and <em>The Old Machine</em>, are the progeny
                  of the “industrial city—its greased axels, its riveted plates,
                  its plane boards, its cables, ladders and tarpaulins, its
                  rust, its crude protective paints, the condensation of its
                  atmosphere”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn65" id="fnref65">65</a></sup>&nbsp;As Clough succinctly put it: “Living rooms are not exactly
                  enough.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn66" id="fnref66">66</a></sup>&nbsp;For Berger, the central “paradox” of Clough’s paintings was
                  her ability to treat landscape with the “intimacy” gained
                  through close looking and scrutiny, hallmarks of the still
                  life genre.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn67" id="fnref67">67</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough’s studies of industrial machinery often contain the
                  composite elements of a detailed still life within them, but
                  fragmented and dislocated.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn68" id="fnref68">68</a></sup>&nbsp;<em>Industrial Interior V</em> (1960) homes in on a section
                  of machinery, the exact function of which remains wilfully
                  obscure (<a href="#cspencer-fig9">fig.&nbsp;9</a>). Clough rendered
                  the dramatically simplified black forms with a strong degree
                  of stillness and isolation, enlivening them momentarily at
                  their centre with a cluster of shapes including a red diamond
                  and a dun-coloured circle, like the atomized building blocks
                  of a still life study.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Clough, meanwhile, saw her subject matter “mainly as
                  landscape”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn69" id="fnref69">69</a></sup>&nbsp;The landscape with which she was engrossed was “the urban or
                  industrial scene or any unconsidered piece of ground”, marked
                  with traces of human labour, littered with parts of machines
                  and the infrastructural detritus of the built environment.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn70" id="fnref70">70</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough’s preference for this terrain emerged early in her
                  career. In the catalogue essay he wrote to accompany her
                  retrospective at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1960, Michael
                  Middleton observed that Clough “paints these things . . .
                  because she is tough-minded, non-escapist, determined to
                  identify herself with the realities of a world shaped by
                  industry, science and technology”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn71" id="fnref71">71</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough and Carr deeply admired the painter Laurence Stephen
                  Lowry, whose work provided a precedent for the serious
                  consideration of what Clough sometimes called “urbscape”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn72" id="fnref72">72</a></sup>&nbsp;Describing several paintings by Lowry that she had seen to
                  Carr, Clough lingered on “the lighter, more open of the two
                  big ones—which has that good strip of shed tops at the bottom
                  and a railway arch. How inexhaustive [<em>sic</em>] his
                  invention is in such detail!”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn73" id="fnref73">73</a></sup>&nbsp;Lowry’s industrial subject matter was a key aspect of his
                  appeal, but his incorporation of observational detail was
                  equally important, and it was this that Clough would carry
                  into her still lifes.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn74" id="fnref74">74</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The paintings that Clough created in the mid- to late 1980s
                  continue to merge still life examination with landscape
                  elements. Many reviews of the Annely Juda show in 1989 seized
                  on the floating quality of Clough’s images, particularly
                  <em>Still Life</em>. Sue Hubbard luxuriated in Clough’s “soft
                  aqueous blues, thin watery greens . . . suggesting a world of
                  ponds and rivers, or the magic of cells viewed under a
                  microscope”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn75" id="fnref75">75</a></sup>&nbsp;Other critics associated Clough’s play with scale, and her
                  oscillation between macrocosmic and microscopic, with
                  intimations of biological life.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn76" id="fnref76">76</a></sup>&nbsp;One reviewer discovered in <em>Still Life</em> a “floating
                  emerald sac—are those eggs inside its belly?”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn77" id="fnref77">77</a></sup>&nbsp;This aqueous quality relates to the seascapes Clough made
                  during and after the Second World War, which elicited the
                  latent surrealism of the landmines and sea-defences that
                  rendered the beaches uninhabitable.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn78" id="fnref78">78</a></sup>&nbsp;The legacy of these landscapes, border zones barred to
                  everyday human use, informs the liminality of works like
                  <em>Still Life</em>. Comparably, the sense of suspension in
                  <em>Industrial Interior V</em>, as if the motion of the
                  machine has just been stopped, or slowed down so that its
                  interlocking segments can be observed, seeps into
                  <em>Still Life</em>’s microscopic perspective.

                  The watery suspension of <em>Still Life</em> also relates to
                  Clough’s paintings of the 1970s that resonate with industrial
                  decline, such as <em>By the Canal</em> (1976). The letters
                  Clough and Carr exchanged during the 1950s cumulatively
                  portray a landscape of lively industry, but by the mid- to
                  late 1970s Clough’s work increasingly responded to the slowing
                  of industrial production.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn79" id="fnref79">79</a></sup>&nbsp;In 1981 the British economic historian Martin J. Wiener
                  asserted that, “by the nineteen-seventies, falling levels of
                  capital investment raised the specter of outright
                  ‘de-industrialization’—a decline in industrial production
                  outpacing any corresponding growth in ‘production’ of
                  services”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn80" id="fnref80">80</a></sup>&nbsp;<em>By the Canal</em> is strikingly minimal in its imagery
                  (<a href="#cspencer-fig10">fig. 10</a>). A rust-coloured
                  rectangle dominates the canvas, bristling with small hooks
                  along one edge. This orange shape, the colour of oxidizing
                  iron and steel, is semi-transparent, merging with the blue of
                  the background. Streaks of thinned paint course down the
                  canvas like rivulets of condensation, so that the overall
                  effect is of metal waste submerged underwater.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Clough had a fondness for canals: “I like looking. Industrial
                  estates, preferably by a canal (watery-flexible) will do.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn81" id="fnref81">81</a></sup>&nbsp;<em>By the Canal</em> was painted when Britain’s canal
                  network had almost completely ceased functioning for
                  commercial purposes.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn82" id="fnref82">82</a></sup>&nbsp;Once the arteries that fed the Industrial Revolution, they
                  sank into gradual decay. Significantly, given Lowry’s
                  importance for Clough, in a 1966 essay on the artist Berger
                  identified his paintings with “a logic . . . of decline” that
                  expressed “what has happened to the British economy since
                  1918, and their logic implies the collapse still to come”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn83" id="fnref83">83</a></sup>&nbsp;According to Berger, Lowry’s paintings provided visual
                  evidence of the “recurring so-called production crisis; the
                  obsolete industrial plants; the inadequacy of unchanged
                  transport systems and overstrained power supplies”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn84" id="fnref84">84</a></sup>&nbsp;Although not quite as apocalyptic as Berger’s analysis,
                  Clough’s re-invention of the still life tradition as
                  “machine-life” comparably considers the life cycle of
                  industrial production, its ebbs and flows, starts and
                  stoppages. Painted over a decade after <em>By the Canal</em>,
                  <em>Still Life</em> shares its impression of indeterminacy and
                  desertion.

                  It is therefore arguably the 1970s, characterized by economic
                  decline, the abandonment of industrial structures, and periods
                  of strike and scarcity, which laid the ground for Clough’s
                  experiments of the 1980s and 1990s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn85" id="fnref85">85</a></sup>&nbsp;The stilled life of Clough’s later paintings executes an
                  oblique but powerful commentary on the impact of the 1970s,
                  which the novelist Margaret Drabble characterized in 1977
                  using the metaphor of “the ice age”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn86" id="fnref86">86</a></sup>&nbsp;Frances Spalding compellingly observes, “it is as if
                  [Clough] wanted to point to the brine and detritus left behind
                  after a wave of modernity recedes, leaving the scraps, orts,
                  fragments and sense of elegy for a vanished ideal.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn87" id="fnref87">87</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough developed the still life genre to such a pitch that
                  it could encapsulate the long, complex history of
                  industrialization and de-industrialization in Britain, through
                  an extremely streamlined and elliptical vocabulary.

                <p>
                  It is, however, important not to forget Clough’s exhilaration
                  at the “first sight” of Pop and Minimalism when considering
                  the still lifes of the 1980s and 1990s. What Heron refers to
                  as the “electrifying strangeness” of <em>Still Life</em> might
                  indicate an intrigued appreciation of outsourced mass
                  production and its effects, as much as (if not more than)
                  despair at stagnation. Clough’s adherence to still life
                  suggests her consistent fascination with the products of
                  industry, and with the possibility that their fluctuating
                  value might endow them with a life of their own at the margins
                  of perception. Equally, Clough’s return to the historical
                  genre of still life during the mid- to late 1980s can be read
                  as an affirmation of painting’s enduring relevance after the
                  doubts of the 1970s, during which the medium risked
                  association with obsolescence, as the melancholy, rusting
                  surface of <em>By the Canal</em> tacitly conveys.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn88" id="fnref88">88</a></sup>&nbsp;By contrast, the works Clough embarked on in the 1980s share
                  in the revivification of Post-Conceptual painting.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn89" id="fnref89">89</a></sup>&nbsp;Critics have downplayed the Postmodern qualities of Clough’s
                  work, but the role of commodity culture and ironic painterly
                  gesture in <em>Toypack: Sword</em>, and even
                  <em>Still Life</em>, entail that these wider debates prove
                  illuminating.

                  Writing in relation to the Post-Conceptual painting of the
                  German artist Gerhard Richter, the philosopher Peter Osborne
                  argues that:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    What is peculiar about post-conceptual painting is that it
                    must treat <em>all</em> forms of painterly representation
                    “knowingly”, as themselves the object of a variety of
                    second-order (non-painterly) representational strategies, if
                    it is to avoid regression to a traditional concept of the
                    aesthetic object. The difficulty is to register this
                    difference without negating the significance of the
                    painterly elements; to exploit the significance of paint
                    without reinstituting a false immediacy.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn90" id="fnref90">90</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The “knowingness” of Clough’s painterly strategy, and her
                  overt engagement with issues of representation, is clearly
                  apparent in paintings like <em>Toypack: Sword</em>, which
                  exploits the “significance of paint”, but acknowledges its
                  remove from the “real”. This effect is one that Hanneke
                  Grootenboer argues still lifes have long enjoyed, possessing
                  as they do “the rare quality of raising the issue of the
                  nature of their own representation”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn91" id="fnref91">91</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough deepens this reflexivity through her choice of
                  subject matter, particularly in the studies of packaging that
                  she first showed at Annely Juda in 1989 such as
                  <em>Vacuum Pack</em> (1988), and continued into the 1990s with
                  works like <em>Package Piece</em> (1998).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn92" id="fnref92">92</a></sup>

                  <em>Vacuum Pack</em> consists of a light grey grid overlaid
                  onto a smeared background, as if a dirty surface has been
                  given a hasty and ineffectual wipe (<a href="#cspencer-fig11">fig. 11</a>). At the top of the painting, a small flare in pastel
                  yellow, green, and pink emerges from the wire-like armature.
                  Rather than the identifiable products celebrated by Pop art,
                  or even by Postmodernism’s embrace of consumer culture,
                  design, and fashion, Clough’s packaging is anonymous,
                  subjected to extreme abstractions and distortions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn93" id="fnref93">93</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough resists what Osborne describes as the restitution of
                  “false immediacy” by emphasizing surface through her focus on
                  packaging, foregrounding the dissimulating nature of her
                  chosen subjects in a way that invokes high modernism’s
                  adherence to the flatness of the picture plane, but ultimately
                  subverts it to reflect instead on what Fredric Jameson
                  theorizes as the “depthlessness” of late capitalism.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn94" id="fnref94">94</a></sup>&nbsp;<em>Vacuum Pack</em> offers an acute comment on this state.
                  Vacuum-packing works by removing the air around an object and
                  encasing it in plastic, to stop products from decaying and
                  facilitate transportation; Clough’s title plays on the
                  implicit paradox of attempting to package an absence or
                  “vacuum”. The subjects of paintings such as
                  <em>Vacuum Pack</em> are not static, identifiable “objects”,
                  and their mutability aligns them with the ceaseless flow of
                  abstracted commodity relations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn95" id="fnref95">95</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The self-depreciating humour that imbues
                  <em>Vacuum Pack</em> corresponds with Post-Conceptual
                  painting’s knowingness. <em>Samples</em> (1997) is perhaps one
                  of Clough’s most “knowingly” ironic paintings. In it, Clough
                  placed a strip of rectangular colour blocks, ranging through
                  grey, pink, blue, green, and yellow, within a dynamic field of
                  paint-marks that parodies the overblown swagger of American
                  Abstract Expressionism (<a href="#cspencer-fig12">fig. 12</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn96" id="fnref96">96</a></sup>&nbsp;The incongruous stripes of pigment resemble the charts
                  produced by commercial paint companies, distributed at home
                  improvement stores.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn97" id="fnref97">97</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough apparently pits the hand of the artist against
                  machine-mixed, chemically calibrated colours. Yet the painting
                  ultimately infers that such a comparison is a false one, as
                  the recherché marks sweeping down the canvas fail to overwhelm
                  the jewel-bright swatch, and seem just as pre-programmed and
                  “false” as the acidic palette of the latter. We are back with
                  Clough on her visit to the paint works, where manufactured
                  colours partake in a process of transformation comparable to
                  the application of paint on canvas in the artist’s studio.

                  <em>Samples</em> functions through the structuring principle
                  of collage. Clough juxtaposes two different image registers,
                  holding them in tension. This collaged quality, together with
                  the titular reference to mixing and matching, signals another
                  key aspect of Clough’s later practice, especially in the
                  1990s. During this decade, Clough ranged across her oeuvre,
                  citing motifs and processes from previous canvases,
                  photographs, assemblages, and prints, recycling them to
                  establish what can be conceptualized as a painterly
                  eco-system. In 1982 Clough reflected: “A painting is made from
                  many . . . events, rather than one; and in fact its sources
                  are many layered and can be quite distant in time, and are
                  rarely if ever direct.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn98" id="fnref98">98</a></sup>&nbsp;These “events” might include forms “left over from other
                  paintings but [which] still demand to be used”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn99" id="fnref99">99</a></sup>&nbsp;In this respect, Clough’s work diverges from dominant trends
                  in Post-Conceptual painting. The ecologies of her abstracted
                  motifs remain deeply imbricated with the history of her own
                  work, and longer histories of painting in Britain, Europe, and
                  the United States. Clough discovers a use-value in the
                  outmoded and discarded that goes beyond knowing irony.

                  Although the collage aspect of Clough’s work intensified in
                  the 1990s, it originated in the 1960s.
                  <em>Untitled (Pink)</em> (1960s) is an intriguing early
                  collage which forms a pendant to <em>Equivalence</em>. Its
                  collaged fragments coalesce on the page of a sketchbook as if
                  only fleetingly arrested (<a href="#cspencer-fig13">fig. 13</a>). Significantly, these pieces appear to have been cut up
                  from one of Clough’s own drawings, rendered dynamically in
                  thick, waxy marks of pencil or crayon. Some sections suggest
                  industrial materials—a filament of wire, iron girders—but the
                  overall impression is of movement and play, while the hot pink
                  colour anticipates Clough’s neon tones of the 1980s and 1990s.
                  <em>Untitled (Pink)</em> verifies the artist’s longstanding
                  interest in collage, specifically the re-appropriation of
                  previously used forms and materials, as both a compositional
                  and conceptual device. The fragment was an important model for
                  Clough, as the artist reflected: “I’ve always found that I
                  have learnt more from some (less accomplished) less resolved
                  (tentative, fragile, smaller) or incomplete work—it’s more
                  accessible; on the other hand . . . there is a real need to
                  feel that one is taking part in something bigger than
                  oneself.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn100" id="fnref100">100</a></sup>&nbsp;An inferred relationship between part and whole in Clough’s
                  collage and assemblage works intimates that she considered
                  each as belonging to a larger system of interlacing interests,
                  ideas, and sources.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The citational qualities of Clough’s works extend to their
                  relationship with the criticism they received. As well as
                  referencing synthetic plastic goods, the saccharine hues
                  Clough employed in the 1980s and 1990s can also be read as a
                  way of deliberately wrong-footing the reviewers who designated
                  her practice as essentially “feminine”. Writing with reference
                  to US women artists grappling with the legacies of Modernism
                  in the 1960s and 1970s, curator Helen Molesworth describes how
                  in the formalist discourse dominated by Clement Greenberg,
                  “the language of quality was largely the province of the
                  critic, whose role it was to put forward the robust discourse
                  of affirmation and persuasion. . . . What this often meant for
                  women artists was a gendered use of language that served to
                  undermine the authority of the works themselves.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn101" id="fnref101">101</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough was subjected to such qualifications throughout her
                  career.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn102" id="fnref102">102</a></sup>&nbsp;Words like “genteel”, “modest”, “feminine”, and “tasteful”,
                  wielded with a strongly gendered subtext, have dogged her
                  critical reception, while Clough’s personal reticence has been
                  repeatedly invoked to explain the ambiguity of her
                  paintings.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn103" id="fnref103">103</a></sup>&nbsp;Clough did not align herself with feminism, but it is
                  tempting to speculate that the colours she chose in the 1980s
                  and 1990s sampled and redeployed the ingrained assumptions of
                  this critical discourse, in order to expose its
                  superficiality.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn104" id="fnref104">104</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Clough’s recurrent return to the stack motif exemplifies her
                  interest in recycling forms. <em>Stack</em> of 1993 is an
                  ambitious, large-scale canvas, in which the titular stack
                  balances on top of a concrete-block-like pedestal (<a href="#cspencer-fig14">fig. 14</a>). This “stack” is configured from rainbow-coloured
                  gradations, glimpsed through bands of horizontal black lines
                  like a ventilator grille. The perforated backdrop, which takes
                  up the majority of the composition, reiterates this emphasis
                  on veiling. Large ragged holes punctuate its black surface,
                  concealing and partially revealing other shapes and brief
                  bursts of colour lurking behind. While the “stack” invites
                  comparisons with the slotted-together contours of chairs and
                  buckets in Clough’s photographs, it equally infers a flat
                  block illuminated at dusk. The scale of the background swings
                  between sky and cells enlarged under a microscope, as in
                  <em>Still Life</em>. Ghosts of multiple structures shadow
                  <em>Stack</em>, from the cooling towers Clough studied in the
                  1950s, to the abandoned industrial sites that appear in
                  canvases of the 1960s and 1970s. Margaret Drabble interprets
                  <em>Stack</em>’s “bright colours” as celebrating “the glory of
                  the world of choice”, yet this dense layering of references
                  embeds it in a far more uneven history of production.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn105" id="fnref105">105</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is further emphasized by <em>Stack</em>’s position within
                  a longer chain of images. In <em>Small Stack</em> of 1996,
                  Clough isolates the stack motif from the earlier painting,
                  which now more than ever resembles a precarious tower of
                  glittering merchandise (<a href="#cspencer-fig15">fig. 15</a>). <em>Small Stack</em>’s title signals its seriality in
                  terms of both content and making, parasitic as it is on the
                  image of 1993. <em>Small Stack</em> also demonstrates how
                  Clough employed found objects to make her work. Clough
                  overlaid the central stack shape with a grid of regular dots,
                  the precision of which indicates they were applied with a
                  stencil. Clough improvised stencils from bits of old mesh,
                  plastic draining boards, and sections of punched card (<a href="#cspencer-fig16">fig. 16</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn106" id="fnref106">106</a></sup>&nbsp;The surface invention of <em>Small Stack</em> stems from a
                  process whereby Clough did not simply reference the obsolete
                  detritus of mass-produced living in her canvases, but used it
                  to generate replicable effects across her paintings. The
                  result suggests that the worlds of painting and mass
                  production are by no means polar opposites, but fundamentally
                  interrelated.

                  Through the connections Clough establishes between it and her
                  other works, <em>Small Stack</em> participates in a painterly
                  eco-system that refuses to ignore the pressures of commodity
                  culture, but proposes ways in which waste items might be
                  endowed with generative potential over time. This achieves its
                  most suggestive expression in <em>Small Stack</em>’s
                  afterlife. The painting featured in Clough’s Camden Arts
                  Centre exhibition of 1996, and was evidently one of the works
                  that the organizers selected to reproduce on promotional
                  postcards. A stack of these samples found its way back to
                  Clough, prompting the artist to meditate on her 1996 painting
                  through its simulacrum. On forty-one postcards of
                  <em>Small Stack</em>, Clough re-worked the image using
                  collaged elements and stencils, exploring the infinite
                  differences within repetition.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn107" id="fnref107">107</a></sup>&nbsp;In some cases, Clough tore away the glossy top layer of the
                  card to mine the furry white seam beneath. Elsewhere, she
                  added drawn and painted elements. Clough overlaid one postcard
                  with a section of red cellophane wrapper, containing a
                  transparent circle stamped with a black letter “B” (<a href="#cspencer-fig17">fig. 17</a>). This aperture frames the “small stack”, but rather than
                  allowing the viewer to focus on the original image, the
                  de-contextualized lettering partially obscures the stack and
                  transforms it into a new entity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn108" id="fnref108">108</a></sup>

                  It could be argued that the <em>Small Stack</em> postcards,
                  particularly when combined with collaged packaging, witness
                  the apotheosis of painting as commodity. Conversely, they
                  might be understood as an attempt to use the former to resist
                  and re-route the latter. Yet rather than either succumbing to
                  the logic of consumption, or providing antidotes to mass
                  production, Clough’s work instead approaches painting and the
                  commodity fetish as part of the same networked ecology.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn109" id="fnref109">109</a></sup>&nbsp;For Theodor Adorno, artworks are “plenipotentiaries of
                  things that are no longer distorted by exchange, profit, and
                  the false needs of a degraded humanity”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn110" id="fnref110">110</a></sup>&nbsp;Despite their aesthetic qualities, Clough’s paintings
                  deliberately test and explore such systems of exchange and
                  profit. By considering objects and images through the models
                  provided by Pop, Minimalism, still life, Post-Conceptual
                  painting and collage, Clough indicates that new eco-systems of
                  ideas and forms must of necessity build on existing processes
                  of exchange and production. Abstraction does not entail
                  removal from these systems and their resulting products, but
                  engagement with them. The poet Stephen Spender caught this
                  paradox in his review of Clough’s first retrospective in 1960:
                  “Her paintings are not abstractions: they are concerned with
                  the nature of things; and great attention to the structure of
                  things reveals, of course, abstraction.” Clough’s works of the
                  1980s and 1990s offer an intense contemplation of painting’s
                  histories, and in so doing propose new angles from which these
                  histories might be viewed.

                        on the abstract works of the late 1950s and early 1960s.

                        Clough lived in London all her life, but visited the
                        east coast regularly. Her family holidayed in Southwold,
                        and in 1945 bought a house there so that the area
                        “remained an important base”. Spalding,

                        Clough’s representation by Juda from 1988 was a success:
                        previously, Juda felt, no one had taken “proper care” of
                        Clough professionally. Juda arrived in Britain from
                        Kassel in Germany, via Palestine, in 1937. She trained
                        as a fashion designer before opening the Molton Gallery
                        in 1960. Annely Juda Fine Art followed in 1968. Annely

                        Clough’s <em>Gate</em> paintings were minimalist, mainly
                        black-and-white works based on an abstracted gate motif.

                        Formica tiles.

                        Marx distinguishes between the use value and exchange
                        value of a commodity, arguing that while sometimes the
                        two are connected there are multiple permutations and
                        distortions of this relation: “for any one commodity
                        there are numerous elementary expressions of value,
                        according as it is brought into a value relation with
                        this or that or the other commodity.” Marx,
                        <em>Capital</em>, 1: 34.

                        <em>Toypack: Sword</em> appears in the 1989 catalogue,
                        but Clough reported in a 1992 letter: “incidentally a
                        painting called TOY PACK 1989 is no more. . . . It is in
                        process of becoming a different caterpilla
                        [<em>sic</em>] / butterfly?” Clough refers to a work
                        called <em>Toypack</em>, rather than
                        <em>Toypack: Sword</em>, and dates it a year later, but
                        it could be the same work. Prunella Clough, letter to

                        Lawrence Alloway would periodize the “switch from the

                        Spalding traces the importance of Minimalism for
                        Clough’s move towards a more rigorous mode of
                        abstraction in the 1970s, exemplified by

                        Joshua Shannon explores the relationship between Judd’s
                        modular, rectangular sculptures of the 1960s and the
                        forms produced by the processes re-making US industry,
                        notably the shipping container and the office: “The
                        sculptures manage to represent not only the forms of the
                        new stage in capitalism but also the logic that those
                        forms endeavoured to naturalize or hide.” Joshua

                        Hanneke Grootenboer proposes that still life is
                        “arguably the most philosophical genre” and a key site
                        for artistic experimentation, noting that “the still
                        lifes of Cézanne are central to Merleau-Ponty’s thought”
                        while the “very first photographs were shots of typical
                        still-life scenes and . . . cubism’s final break with
                        realism developed within a series of still-life

                        Aspects of these works are reminiscent of Henry Moore’s
                        organic figure studies. Clough took sculpture classes
                        with Moore at the Chelsea School of Art (then part of
                        Chelsea Polytechnic) in the late 1930s. She reflected:
                        “Work under Moore was a deliberate if juvenile exercise
                        in 3 dimensional realisation for the benefit of work in
                        2—a thing inconceivable to regret.” Clough, diary entry

                        overgrown towpaths. One had a rich experience of nature,

                        Drabble’s eponymous novel of industrial decline charts a
                        terrain similar to Clough’s paintings. Drabble’s
                        protagonist Anthony Keating, a property developer,
                        acquires a gasometer: “It was not a very expensive
                        gasometer, for the gas board had abandoned it some years
                        earlier, on the advent of North Sea Gas, but it was a
                        useful site, which would join very neatly onto a
                        brewer’s yard and an old bomb site, and possibly a whole
                        stretch of river frontage.” Margaret Drabble,
                        <em>The Ice Age</em> (1977; London: Penguin, 1978), 31.
                        Clough felt that “a gasometer is as good as a garden,
                        probably better.” Prunella Clough, “Statement”, from

                        The examples are too many to list in their entirety. A
                        couple suffice: Edward Lucie-Smith detected a “lack of
                        ambition” in Clough’s work, despite the fact that he was
                        writing after her major Whitechapel retrospective of
                        1960. Edward Lucie-Smith, “Round the Art Galleries:

                        backhanded compliment: “where scale is concerned there
                        is a ‘recommended maximum’ above which women’s art
                        decreases very sharply in its effectiveness. Someone who
                        knows this and does not go outside her own best
                        capacities is Prunella Clough.” John Russell, untitled

                        As early as 1966 Clough was held up as one of the “few
                        really influential women” artists who had overcome
                        institutional prejudices. Fiona MacCarthy, “Fiona

                        <em>Guardian</em>, 28 Feb. 1966, 6. Monica Petzal noted
                        that Clough, together with Gillian Ayres, “represented
                        for several generations of younger women
                        artists—including myself—the most invaluable of
                        role-models”. Monica Petzal, “Prunella Clough, Gillian

                        Clough’s aunt, the designer and architect Eileen Grey,
                        provided a role model that “did allow for other
                        possibilities”. Clough, “Clough and Riley”, 2–3.

                  The cover of the first issue of
                  <em>British Art Studies</em> plays with the conventions of the
                  traditional cover of a journal or magazine. A cover
                  traditionally has various functions: to illustrate or give a
                  glimpse into the contents; to protect the pages sandwiched in
                  between; and, occasionally, to conceal rather than advertise
                  what is inside. The digital format of
                  <em>British Art Studies</em> has allowed us to rethink what a
                  cover is and what it can do. We have created more than simply
                  a landing page for presenting text and practical information
                  and made a feature worth visiting in its own right. The cover
                  images selected for issue one do not illustrate any of the
                  articles, but generate a stand-alone feature. For the first
                  issue, we have collaborated with
                  <a href="#http-britishartshow8-com" target="_blank">British Art Show 8</a>
                  (BAS 8) to make a cover that does not simply point to the
                  content within but also connects outwards. Featuring new works
                  by eight artists, who are all participating in BAS 8, the
                  cover is never static and a fresh image will load each time
                  you return to the journal. In this text, Roger Malbert, Head
                  of Hayward Touring (the organization responsible for the
                  British Art Show) reflects on the idea and history of the
                  show. Exhibitions’ histories have been a focus of research
                  activity at the Paul Mellon Centre and the Yale Center for
                  British Art recently through events such as a joint session at
                  the Association of
                  <a href="#http-www-aah-org-uk-annual-conference-sessions2015-session6" target="_blank">Art Historians conference in 2015</a>, and a forthcoming conference in collaboration with Tate
                  Britain on exhibitions of

                  conversation to consider the implications of exhibiting the
                  contemporary under the rubric of “British art”, intersecting
                  with the topic of our Conversation Piece, “There’s no such
                  thing as British art”.

                  A History of the British Art Show
                </h1>
                <p>
                  The idea of an exhibition of contemporary British art, touring
                  at five-yearly intervals to different regional cities, was
                  first proposed to the Exhibitions Committee of the Arts
                  Council of Great Britain (ACGB) by the legendary Director of
                  Sheffield City Art Galleries, Frank Constantine, in the late
                  1970s. The Hayward Gallery, which was run by the ACGB, had
                  initiated a series of influential—and often
                  controversial—Annuals in 1977, focusing on aspects of
                  contemporary art. The British Art Show was intended to offer
                  regional museums and galleries an exhibition of equivalent
                  scale and significance, a survey of current practice selected
                  by guest curators and travelling each time to four different
                  cities. Implicit in the idea from the start was a wish to
                  redress the balance between the capital and the peripheries.

                  As the national funding body, the ACGB was always at pains to
                  demonstrate its regional credentials and even-handedness. It
                  was important that the British Art Show curators were seen to
                  be visiting studios in every part of the country over an
                  exhaustive two-year period of research—even though, as Joanna
                  Drew, then Director of Art, remarked in 1984, they might
                  ultimately come up with a list they could have arrived at
                  sitting around a table in the Arts Council’s offices in
                  Piccadilly in a single afternoon. From the second edition on,
                  London and Glasgow predominated, as they do today. The
                  exhibition has at times been bitterly criticized for its bias
                  in favour of the metropolis and, in the eighties and nineties,
                  a particular art college—Goldsmiths. In retrospect, however,
                  the curators’ choices seem on the whole to have been
                  vindicated: there are relatively few major artists working in
                  this country who have not appeared in one or another edition
                  of the British Art Show. The formula of two or three
                  well-informed guest curators basing their selection on
                  empirical research, focusing exclusively on current activity,
                  with no chance to roam back in time to make historical
                  connections (which many curators are keen to do, as the Tate’s
                  comparatively short-lived Triennial illustrates), has become
                  the show’s signature.

                <p>
                  An interval of five years is long enough for a new generation
                  to emerge from art colleges and for new tendencies in practice
                  to become apparent. The ostensibly parochial notion of a show
                  confined to British art is mitigated by a loose definition of
                  the criteria, and the fact that over the past thirty years
                  London, the largest city in Europe by far (population 8.63
                  million, compared to its nearest rival Berlin’s 3.5 million)
                  has been a magnet for artists from across the world. This,
                  combined with the complex legacy of Britain’s imperial
                  history, means that simple ideas of national identity are
                  problematized almost out of existence. What can one say then,
                  about the characteristics of “British art” as they have been
                  revealed by the British Art Show over the past thirty-five
                  years?

                            Many of the 39 artists in British Art Show 7 created
                            new works for the exhibition. Like British Art Show
                            6, the exhibition changed and developed as it
                            toured, with new works being added each time. The

                  Reviewing the eight editions of the British Art Show at a
                  glance, certain obvious features stand out. They can be seen
                  to reflect changes in culture, patterns of production, and the
                  growth of new technologies as well as demographic and social
                  shifts. The first edition in 1979 seems comparatively
                  homogenous; the names of the 112 artists included are
                  overwhelmingly English, and only 12 were women. This was a
                  wide-ranging, if partial, painting and sculpture survey show.
                  It includes such major figures as Lucian Freud, Bridget Riley,
                  Richard Long, Michael Andrews, Terry Frost, David Hockney,
                  John Hoyland, Michael Sandle, Euan Uglow, and Sean Scully.

                  A significant shift occurred with the next British Art Show in
                  1984. The artist Jon Thompson, who as Head of Goldsmiths
                  Department of Art in the 1980s revolutionized art education in
                  this country by dissolving specialist departments, allowing
                  students to move freely between media, and employing many
                  experimental artists on a part-time basis, co-curated with
                  Marjorie Allthorpe-Guyton and Scottish artist Sandy Moffat.
                  The show bore the stamp of his radical open-minded approach
                  with an astonishingly catholic selection encompassing every
                  kind of practice from figurative painting to performance and
                  video. Among the eighty-four names, hardly a single one is
                  forgotten today. The list includes Anthony Caro, Michael
                  Craig-Martin, Stuart Brisley, Paula Rego, Gilbert &amp;
                  George, Helen Chadwick, Mary Kelly, R. B. Kitaj and Howard
                  Hodgkin. Perhaps most timely is the group of young sculptors,
                  many of whom were associated with the Lisson Gallery: Tony
                  Cragg, Bill Woodrow, Richard Wentworth, Richard Deacon, Antony
                  Gormley, Anish Kapoor, Shirazeh Houshiary, and Alison Wilding.
                  If there was a common characteristic to much of this work. It
                  was considered at the time to be peculiarly full of “English”
                  irony and wit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the British Art Show has, over time, registered
                  developments in contemporary art, it has also reflected
                  changes in curatorial practice, moving away from the idea of a
                  neutral survey to a more conceptually considered and “shaped”
                  exhibition: from an over-crowded group show towards a more
                  calculatedly composed, minimalist presentation. The third
                  incarnation in 1990 took a turn away from the
                  cross-generational survey, to focus exclusively on artists
                  under the age of thirty-five. This was a quieter exhibition,
                  with some outstanding contributions from Mona Hatoum, Cornelia
                  Parker, Rachel Whiteread, Gary Hume, Julian Opie, and Callum
                  Innes. As a record of a moment, it affirmed the hegemony of
                  Goldsmiths and consequently provoked an indignant reaction
                  from Julian Spalding. The then Director of Glasgow Museums,
                  where the exhibition opened, publicly denounced it as “not a
                  British art show” (since it was unapologetically partial), and
                  proceeded to organize his own counter-exhibition, The Great
                  British Art Show, with a line-up of figurative painters,
                  including Beryl Cook. Opening a new Gallery of Modern Art in
                  Glasgow, Spalding began to acquire this type of work of
                  popular appeal and resolutely refused to countenance
                  collecting work by emerging Glaswegian artists such as (the
                  now internationally renowned) Douglas Gordon. The conflict
                  epitomized a fundamental divide in Scottish art at that time
                  between those who could be categorized as the provincial
                  populists, and the savvy conceptualists who were performing
                  with confidence on the international stage, and whose work has
                  been acquired and promoted by the Gallery of Modern Art since
                  Spalding’s departure.

                  The British Art Show reached a watershed in 1995, when the
                  exhibition broke away from the confines of a single venue to
                  spread across numerous galleries and exhibition spaces in each
                  city. The standards of presentation (particularly of video and
                  film projections) reached new heights in order to satisfy the
                  requirements of a highly professional and ambitious generation
                  of twenty-five artists, including Steve McQueen, Sam
                  Taylor-Wood, Tacita Dean, Damien Hirst, Chris Ofili, Douglas
                  Gordon, Jane and Louise Wilson, and Mark Wallinger. This was
                  the YBA moment. Plenty has been written about this generation
                  of artists and their influence persists. They have
                  international reputations, are represented by high-powered
                  galleries, collected by museums across the world, and several
                  now live abroad.

                  Subsequent iterations of the British Art Show have expanded to
                  include many more artists (54 for BAS 5 in 2000 and 50 in BAS
                  6 in 2005, 22 of whom were women), with a good proportion of
                  each continuing with successful careers. Phyllida Barlow,
                  Martin Creed, Liam Gillick, Michael Landy, Sarah Lucas, Mike
                  Nelson, Grayson Perry, David Shrigley, Wolfgang Tillmans were
                  all in BAS 5; Tomma Abts, Zarina Bhimji, Marcus Coates, Roger
                  Hiorns, Mark Leckey, Goshka Macuga, Zineb Sedira, and Mark
                  Titchner were all in BAS 6—whose co-curator, Alex Farquharson,
                  incidentally, later became the Director of Nottingham
                  Contemporary and has recently been appointed Director of Tate
                  Britain. The challenge he faces there is relevant to the
                  question under consideration here: what, if anything, defines
                  British art? The wise response would probably follow
                  Wittgenstein’s dictum, that the meaning of a term lies in its
                  use, rather than in some essential definition. All of the many
                  thousands of artists living in London, Glasgow,
                  and—increasingly as the capital prices the property-less out
                  of the picture—across the country, would qualify for
                  inclusion, whatever their country of origin.

                  is a touring exhibition and it will travel to four UK cities —
                  Leeds, Edinburgh, Norwich and Southampton — between October
                  2015 to January 2017. The curators of BAS8, Anna Colin and
                  Lydia Yee, have selected the work of forty-two artists who
                  have made a significant contribution to contemporary art in
                  the UK over the past five years. The result is a wide-ranging
                  exhibition that encompasses performance, film, sculpture,
                  installation, and painting and design. Twenty-six of the 42
                  artists have produced new works for the exhibition, making
                  this the most ambitious British Art Show to date.

                <p>
                  A central concern of British Art Show 8 is the changing role
                  and status of the physical object in an increasingly digital
                  age. While some artists engage with this question through
                  traditional craft-based techniques, others experiment with
                  modes of industrial production. As the curators comment, “We
                  were particularly interested in the rereading of objects by
                  artists and other contemporary thinkers as active agents,
                  generative entities, mutating forms and networked
                  realities.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>

                        This feature takes the Slade School of Fine Art as the
                        starting point for a global microhistory and reimagines
                        ways of engaging with, co-constituting, and curating a
                        research archive in pursuit of this endeavour. It
                        consists of two parts: contributions in this issue of
                        British Art Studies focus on the immediate post-war
                        period, roughly 1945 to 1965, and a forthcoming second
                        part will consider the 1960s to the 1990s. In this
                        issue, the feature comprises a narrative history that
                        interrogates the Slade’s role as a contrapuntal node,
                        and a companion archival feature that brings together
                        materials from multiple institutional and personal
                        archives in Asia and the United Kingdom (UK). Building
                        upon Edward Said’s use of the musical metaphor of
                        contrapuntalism to address both the presence of empire
                        in the metropolis and the construction of a
                        transnational counterpoint with multiple voices, this
                        project seeks to surface histories at the intersection
                        of art education, imperialism, and decolonization. By
                        using the Slade as a transversal line that connects
                        multiple people and histories from Bangladesh, India,
                        Pakistan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia, Singapore,
                        Nigeria, Sudan, Uganda, Britain and beyond, this essay
                        proposes new ways of writing histories of

                        This article builds on my research and experience as
                        co-curator of THIRTY QUEENS, a hybrid exhibition-event,
                        which took place at the contemporary artist-led space
                        LOWER.GREEN, Norwich in 2019, exploring the artist
                        Gustav Metzger’s time in King’s Lynn in the 1950s.
                        King’s Lynn laid the foundations for Metzger’s later
                        fusion of art and activism, and movement from painted or
                        sculpted objects towards event-like works. But it was
                        also in King’s Lynn that Metzger learned how to live,
                        work, and practise as an artist outside of a
                        cosmopolitan centre and was compelled by the imaginative
                        purchase of the historical and the antiquarian.
                        Throughout his time in the town, Metzger scraped a
                        living dealing in furniture, antiques, and books,
                        briefly taking on a shop where, as Thirty Queens, he
                        would also organise selling exhibitions. This
                        mixed-economy (not strictly non-commercial) model of
                        artistic production and distribution is an unusual and
                        useful case study to think about British art of the
                        1950s outside of the capital. With Thirty Queens,
                        Metzger was trying to position himself not as peripheral
                        but as an extension of a London-centric British art
                        scene, while providing a platform for regional art and
                        antiquity. Structured around sites of significance, this
                        article presents the first comprehensive account of
                        Metzger’s time in King’s Lynn, and maps his concerns
                        onto those of contemporary artistic and curatorial
                        practices in the region. It demonstrates that Thirty
                        Queens provides a lens onto the recent history of
                        British artist-led and alternative art spaces. Drawing
                        together archival research, interviews and oral
                        histories, exhibition histories, and field trips, this
                        article makes use of Mathieu Copeland’s recently
                        published volume of Metzger’s writing and finds
                        particularising, anecdotal detail in Clive Phillpot’s
                        conversations with Gustav Metzger recorded in 1997 for
                        the National Sound Archive. Centring the artist’s voice,
                        this article argues that it is necessary to extend the
                        characterisation of Metzger’s work to include that of
                        artist-dealer, artist-curator, and artist-activist. What
                        emerges, also, is a picture of the artist at work, often
                        in poverty and unwavering in his political convictions.

                      <div class="abstract-text">
                        Zarina Bhimji’s work debuted in London in the 1980s,
                        during a period that witnessed important revisionist
                        critiques from the feminist and Black British art
                        movements. Her early photo-text installations, primarily
                        created while&nbsp;she was a student at Goldsmiths’
                        College, address issues surrounding diaspora, the body,
                        and the inhumanity of Britain’s immigration process.
                        While these understudied works are most often framed in
                        relation to postmodernist identity politics, Bhimji’s
                        work avoids overtly political signifiers, instead
                        privileging symbolically charged indices and abstract
                        visual tableaux. As the artist states, “The language I
                        use is related to vulnerability and this is not a
                        culturally specific emotion”. Working toward a more
                        holistic understanding of Bhimji’s art and its context,
                        this article places it in dialogue with that of Mary
                        Kelly, who taught at Goldsmiths throughout the 1980s and
                        whose own production in London bridged the artistic and
                        discursive boundaries that divided the art of&nbsp;the
                        time. In so doing, it positions Bhimji in relation to
                        both surrealist and second-wave feminist artists through
                        her interest in affect, memory, and the symbolic
                        representation of enigmatic childhood and domestic
                        objects as expressions of subjectivity and the
                        unconscious. As such, it demonstrates that postcolonial
                        artists&nbsp;such as Bhimji are central, not peripheral,
                        to the development of British contemporary art history.

                      <div class="abstract-text">
                        Art and anatomy in the nineteenth century were
                        intimately linked male-dominated professions, where hand
                        and eye united. These activities were key interconnected
                        sites of male bonding, of growing professional identity
                        formation, and of the construction of modern
                        masculinity. For the Irish-born Maclise brothers, Daniel
                        and Joseph, the bonds were also fraternal: brothers
                        living and working together in London throughout their
                        lives with a shared passion for life drawing, anatomy,
                        and the human figure in pictorial representation.
                        Dissecting, in particular, the lithographic drawings of
                        surgeon-artist Joseph Maclise (1815–1880) in Richard
                        Quain’s The Anatomy of the Arteries of the Human Body
                        (1840–circa 1844) and his own Surgical Anatomy (1851,
                        1856, and 1859), this essay tracks the lifeblood of the
                        anatomical arts circulating around the networks of
                        specialists with whom Maclise was associated, from Cork
                        and the capitals of Scotland, England, and France,
                        across the Atlantic to Philadelphia and Boston. At a
                        time when travel was far slower, surgeons, artists, and
                        printmakers travelled long distances in search of
                        greater learning, the flow returning to generate new
                        knowledges in its places of origin. Like the Grand Tour,
                        these journeys often lasted far longer than a passing
                        tourist visit, at times entailing months or years of
                        professional study and work—as in Joseph Maclise’s
                        anatomy studies in Paris. The anatomical work, and its
                        representation in images and texts, was thereby
                        circulating in shared ideas, practices, teaching, books,
                        manuals, atlases, art, and crucially, given that the
                        (primarily) white male body was the “universal” body in
                        medical anatomy, in shared ways of seeing and
                        constituting the human (male) body.

                  What does it mean to correlate art and art history with
                  “nation”? At the time of publication, the full impact and
                  effects of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European
                  Union are just beginning to manifest. In this feature, we are
                  interested in the art-historical, historiographic, curatorial,
                  political, legal, creative, and other aspects of how Brexit
                  impacts on art making and the study of art history in relation
                  to Britain. In light of Brexit and its attendant nationalist
                  politics, we also envisage this Conversation Piece to be part
                  of an ongoing dialogue about what it means to conceptualise a
                  national art history, which in Britain’s case encompasses its
                  pre-colonial and colonial pasts and neoliberal global
                  presents.

                  The idea of “British art” has always been problematic. This
                  has been highlighted in particular by art and architectural
                  historians who work with material created before the concepts
                  of “Britain” and “British” existed as commonly used signifiers
                  of national identity, or implied meanings not carried by those
                  terms today. Within art history, and the humanities more
                  broadly, the rationale for using “nation” as an organisational
                  category has long been scrutinised and discussed.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  In 1994, in
                  <em>Welcome to the Jungle: New Positions in Black Cultural
                    Studies</em>, Kobena Mercer asked “Why the need for nation?”, underlining
                  the critical energy that such questions brought to the
                  activities of Black British artists and their ability to
                  undermine racist and fascist constructions of nationhood.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  In curatorial practice, the category of the nation appears to
                  have been re-energised as a place of geopolitical critique,
                  emerging more as a testing ground for questioning than as a
                  descriptive, legal, or bureaucratic term.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  These efforts issue a challenge to redefine the relationship
                  of art and its histories to nationhood from both within and
                  beyond Britain. As Catherine Grant and Dorothy Price wrote in
                  their “Decolonizing Art History” feature for
                  <em>Art History</em> (2020),
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    the backdrop of Brexit cannot be ignored, along with the
                    impact of austerity and precarity in the university and
                    museum sectors, and the rise of nationalism and xenophobia
                    in response to both economic and political migration. There
                    is a sense of instability in the political landscape, and
                    conversations are often harder to hear than accusations,
                    condemnation or dismissal.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>

                  We are “in” rather than “after” Brexit. Behind the theatre of
                  the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, many important
                  mechanisms of collaboration in the arts have been, or are in
                  the process of being, dismantled. Although much remains
                  uncertain, immediate realities include the loss of around £40
                  million of EU arts funding per year, the UK’s withdrawal from
                  the Erasmus scheme, and more complicated restrictions on
                  moving, working, buying, and selling, between the UK and EU
                  member states.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  If the UK becomes an expensive and prohibitive place to study,
                  if access to EU research funding is not replaced, and if
                  cultural institutions begin to see cross-Channel collaboration
                  as a risk not worth taking, will these logistical borders be
                  replicated in the future of how we understand art in Britain?

                  Brexit, we must also ask what it means to make, study, and
                  curate “British” art in a neo-nationalist climate,
                  particularly when the current UK Government exercises
                  political control of the arts, intervening in decisions that
                  curators and educators are trained to make.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  In so doing, the history of Britain’s resurgent and recurrent
                  nationalisms simultaneously points to an orientation entwined,
                  as Paul Gilroy has incisively shown over several decades, with
                  the empire and its decline, racism, “postcolonial melancholia”
                  and violence.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  This begs the question of why the compulsion to study national
                  schools endures.

                  Brexit has amplified problems surrounding borders—physically
                  and conceptually; within the UK and internationally—making
                  Britain’s status as an island more palpable. While the
                  character of these tensions has shifted over time, both the
                  first referendum to leave the EU, in 1975, and the most recent
                  one, in 2016, have made the distinctions between England,
                  Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland more apparent and
                  uncomfortable.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                  We encouraged responses to this provocation that consider the
                  impact of these reconfigurations on art making, the
                  interpretation of historical and contemporary art, and the
                  wider cultural field. How does Brexit change
                  conceptualisations—past and present—of English, Northern
                  Irish, Scottish, and Welsh art? How is the imagery and
                  language of Brexit entering into the cultural imagination of
                  Britain? How can art history account for the art and culture
                  of the “borderlands”?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  What images and ideas of “British art” are being produced from
                  beyond its physical borders? What can the longer histories of
                  the artistic relationships between Britain and Europe tell us
                  about how geographical and conceptual borders have been
                  crossed, negotiated, and bypassed by cultural forms? And what
                  can we learn from how the movement of European art historians
                  to Britain in the past has shaped the field of art history?
                  Finally, looking at the present, has Brexit instigated
                  artists, writers, curators, and historians to imagine
                  alternative forms of association and practice which reimagine
                  or cast aside national frameworks?

                  With these words, the Mayor of Bordeaux, Pierre Hurmic,
                  introduces the sumptuous exhibition catalogue
                  <em>Absolutely Bizarre! Les drôles d’histoires de l’Ecole de
                    Bristol (1800–1840)</em>. The exhibition, which opened on 10 June 2021 and showcases
                  eighty works by nineteenth-century artists including Francis
                  Danby, Edward Bird, and Rolinda Sharples, has taken nearly
                  five years to prepare (<a href="#baab-fig2">Fig. 2</a>). It is
                  a collaboration between the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Bordeaux,
                  the Louvre, Paris, and Bristol Museum &amp; Art Gallery, with
                  additional loans from the Victoria Art Gallery in Bath and
                  Tate. Work on this international project started just a few
                  months after the Brexit referendum and successfully bridged
                  the transition period and the final departure of the UK from
                  the EU.

                  As a German curator of British and European art who works in
                  the UK, Brexit has had more than a professional or academic
                  impact on me. Even just focusing on the collections of British
                  art in the UK and the ongoing work required to research,
                  de-colonise, and interpret them—and make them accessible to
                  all—it seems obvious to me that such essential curatorial
                  tasks cannot be done outside a European context even after
                  Brexit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To me, maintaining this “European context” relates first to
                  the continental European study and reception of British art,
                  through projects such as Bordeaux’s exhibition: we need the
                  external, yet informed and congenial perspective that
                  side-steps British preconceptions of what British art is.
                  Bristol and Bordeaux have been trading for centuries and have
                  been twinned as cities for over seventy years—to our
                  colleagues at the Musée des Beaux-Arts and their audiences,
                  the Bristol School is not a minor regional phenomenon: it is
                  simply British art history.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My hope is that the dedication required to stage such a major
                  project, or even just the possibility for European researchers
                  and curators to come to the UK and vice versa to discuss
                  British art together, will continue despite new restrictions
                  to travel and immigration. But I worry that a lack of foreign
                  language confidence on the part of British art curators and
                  museum professionals might make this work more difficult and
                  could broaden the gap to Europe—what is the situation at
                  British art history departments?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Secondly, it must be remembered that British art has never
                  existed in isolation. Francis Danby, Irish-born, spent years
                  working in Switzerland and France and brought continental
                  thinking back with him when he returned to live in England—how
                  about showing him alongside French artists? And for hundreds
                  of years European artists (as well as art historians and
                  curators) have come to Britain, co-exhibited, coexisted,
                  co-shaped its art—even if this annoyed Britons as far back as
                  William Hogarth. These contributors should not be written out
                  of British art history.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is no British art exceptionalism and there is no point
                  in focusing solely on the local—a suggestion which some in the
                  museum world might pander to in order to heal the Brexit
                  divide. What is the local anyway? Over three million Europeans
                  are still living in the UK and they too are our audiences, as
                  are those who have come to the UK from around the globe. For
                  the successful decolonisation of British art history which we
                  owe our diverse audiences, we also need the comparison with
                  other European art histories undergoing the same process.

                <p>
                  As someone living in France, I first experienced Brexit
                  through the delivery of a book on Thomas Gainsborough. I was
                  surprised when the postman told me I owed an extra
                  twenty-eight euros. It was a charge resulting from the new
                  customs rules, he said. Meanwhile, I had noticed that British
                  magazines took longer to arrive—when they arrived at all.
                  These moments of friction may be anecdotal, but they have
                  introduced a new form of temporality to cultural production
                  and its accessibility, impacting bookshops, libraries,
                  universities, and museums downstream. What does Brexit do to
                  the study, the teaching of British art? In her important book
                  <em>Transporting Visions: The Movement of Images in Early
                    America</em>
                  (2014), Jennifer Roberts proposed an alternative reading of
                  artistic creation that looked at how the numerous physical
                  displacements and removals to which a work of art may be
                  subjected informs its very production. In this context, some
                  exhibitions will no longer travel to Europe, and perhaps will
                  never be organised in the first place. If we think about books
                  or artworks as objects not only for themselves but also for
                  their relations to the world, we have to reflect upon the
                  pockets of meaning prompted by their circulation and, in the
                  present Brexit-inspired case study, the time lag in the
                  cross-cultural encounters they generate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is not just art theory. These new forms of temporal lag
                  affect real people. Among the most noted consequences of
                  Brexit is its interference with student exchange programmes.
                  In the Turing scheme,&nbsp;which replaces the Erasmus programme in
                  the UK, the emphasis is placed on <em>going</em> abroad. Very
                  little is said, however, about incoming students, who, for
                  now, will most likely have to pay exorbitant international
                  fees. Anna Rossi is an artist who, as a student at the
                  Beaux-Arts de Paris, was able to do her Erasmus exchange at
                  the Slade, University College London (<a href="#baab-fig3">Fig. 3</a>). People tend to forget that fine arts students also benefit
                  from the program, as these exchanges are often made invisible
                  by conventions on artist CVs.

                  Equally, the consequences of Brexit have become almost
                  inextricably tangled with the impact of the COVID-19 crisis,
                  doubly tying up and suspending vital flows of cultural
                  exchange. It is almost impossible to predict what restrictions
                  will remain in place after the health crisis has passed. The
                  pandemic-related restrictions are thus superimposed on the
                  consequences of Brexit, forming a calcified and contradictory
                  conjuncture: on the one hand, the hardening of nationalist
                  ideology; on the other, a virus which knows no frontiers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thinking about who has access to British art shifts how we
                  understand the academic field, the canon, and related teaching
                  curricula. If we think about *organ-*isation and its corollary
                  <em>dis-organ</em>-isation as a metaphor, perhaps we then
                  should think about British art in terms of *organ-*isms. Could
                  we consider things from the point of view of ecosystems, the
                  molecular angle in which frontiers are not as rigid? Critical
                  fields and artists that look to phenomena such as viruses or
                  bacteria can prompt us to rethink the relationships between
                  culture and the environments and territories in which we live.
                  From this perspective, the study of Britain and British art
                  can be less narrow and more rhizomic. The crises we are now
                  living through require of us an expanded definition of
                  national art, and of how we understand the term
                  <em>nation</em> itself, drawing on different fields to
                  construct non-hierarchical ontologies that question existing
                  hegemonies in the present.

                  Struggling with Plurals and “Island Artists”
                </h1>
                <p>
                  As art institutions struggle with the harsh economic
                  implications of Brexit, cultural debates have blossomed around
                  controversial ideas of our “island nation”. The recent
                  Brexit-related collusion of geography, history, and politics
                  to reclaim an identity steeped in self-determination and
                  “separateness” has enhanced the relevance of the island theme.
                  Problems of definition notwithstanding, islands can be seen to
                  have immutable borders (the sea) and uncontested geographies.
                  Yet the idea of the island has been read as both open and
                  closed, and, as such, they offer rich material for writers and
                  artists. Recent debates have harnessed these imaginative
                  possibilities in contradictory ways. The writer Madeleine
                  Bunting has argued that being part of an island has been a
                  central part of English nationalism. She points out that
                  generations of children learned their history from H.E.
                  Marshall’s <em>Our Island Story</em> (1905), despite the fact
                  that the title is based on some obvious mistakes: “England
                  shares an island with other nations, and the UK is actually an
                  archipelago of about 6,300 islands. English nationalism
                  struggles with plurals”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This historic inability to see Britain—and England—as part of
                  a connected archipelago has informed the work of several
                  contemporary British artists who have reimagined ideas of both
                  nationhood and “islandness”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                  Several years before the 2016 referendum, the British artist
                  Alex Hartley conceived of a multi-national island-state in his
                  floating installation <em>Nowhereisland</em>, which was partly
                  made up of rocks taken from a land mass that appeared in the
                  Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. Towed down the south-west
                  coast of England during the 2012 Olympics,
                  <em>Nowhereisland</em> boasted a portable embassy and invited
                  all people to claim citizenship.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  According to Hartley, during its development “we always talked
                  about the idea of an island as a node of connectivity rather
                  than a place alone and separated”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>
                  This connectivity is also central to the work of the British
                  artist Tania Kovats. Her
                  <em>All the Islands of All the Seas</em> (2016) consists of
                  thirty-six works, each containing up to ten different layered
                  drawings of landmasses. Traced from atlases onto translucent
                  paper, Kovats’s islands float across each other, giving up
                  their geographic, cartographic, and cultural certainty—a
                  system of plurals (<a href="#baab-fig4">Fig. 4</a>).

                  The label “island writers” is often used to identify a body of
                  postcolonial writing from former British colonies in
                  Caribbean, Indian, and Pacific archipelagos. These writers
                  (including the St Lucian poet Derek Walcott) “have rendered
                  island spaces as vital and dynamic loci of cultural and
                  material exchange”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
                  As a series of small nations connected by the sea, they have
                  profited from fluid, transcultural, diasporic, and regional
                  alliances. Martiniquan writer Edouard Glissant has described
                  the “openness” embodied by these islands: “the dialectic
                  between inside and outside is reflected in the relationship
                  between land and sea”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>
                  For Kovats, Hartley and other contemporary British artists
                  (including, for example, Simon Faithful and Tacita Dean), the
                  sea is vital to the spatial scale of island imagination,
                  enabling my parallel designation of “island artists”. In their
                  work, the sea can act as a metaphor of connectivity within and
                  beyond archipelagos. It can defy colonial and pro-Brexit
                  narratives of separate island status and affirm the important
                  role of art in the United Kingdom’s “struggle with plurals”.

                  In 2018, faced with the prospect of his own suicide driven by
                  financial struggles, Roberto Pirrone instead shot another man,
                  Idy Diene, a Senegalese vendor in Florence. Later, the white
                  man told the police that he could not think straight when he
                  had envisioned murder as an alternative to taking his own
                  life. Pirrone’s brutal logic cost him a thirty-year
                  imprisonment (also taking him out of financial misery), while
                  it cost Diene his life, “devalued by a racial calculus and a
                  political arithmetic that were entrenched centuries ago”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>
                  When the Italian police ruled out racism as the motive behind
                  the killing, the Senegalese community in the city started to
                  gather on the scene to demonstrate their anger. Some rubbish
                  bins were kicked, a couple of flowerpots were broken.
                  Commenting on the effects of the demo, the mayor defined the
                  Senegalese protest as vandalism, thus shifting the national
                  discussion away from racism and blaming the victims.

                  Diene was one of the many migrant workers and refugees who
                  arrived in Europe via what Ida Danewid and others have termed
                  the Black Mediterranean, not so much a geographical space as a
                  historical condition of diaspora, shaped by the impact of
                  centuries of French, Italian, and British colonial rule.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>
                  One year after Diene’s assassination, Phoebe Boswell, the
                  Bridget Riley Fellow at the British School at Rome (BSR),
                  exhibited a multimedia installation titled <em>Wake Work</em>,
                  which included a four-panel group portrait drawn from press
                  images of the Senegalese community members who protested in
                  Florence, and three smashed flowerpots (<a href="#baab-fig5">Fig. 5</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>

                  As an act of both remembrance and re-enactment, the broken
                  flowerpots remove the institutional gaze away from the
                  discourse of race and re-centre it on the complex connections
                  between history and property: the property of the municipal
                  flowerpots damaged by the protesters; the colonial legacies of
                  the British Schools across the Mediterranean; and the
                  devaluation of Idy Diene’s life subjected to “racial
                  calculus”. Britain’s impending exit from the European Union in
                  2019 should be taken as a context to think about Boswell’s
                  work, but also as the text on which she intervenes to redact
                  and annotate the role of British art institutions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup>
                  While her initial project aimed to involve migrants and
                  refugees in Rome marked by the experience of the Black
                  Mediterranean, she quickly started to interrogate the
                  relationship between the whiteness of the institution and
                  Black optics—the structural limits which come to define the
                  work of a Black artist only in relation to Blackness as
                  spectacle. Interestingly, <em>Wake Work</em> is now part of
                  Italian art history as well, having been taken on board by
                  Black Italian artists and academics to mobilise the
                  transnational coalitions of solidarity and resilience through
                  which the installation has acquired even deeper meanings.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">22</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The institutional and political entanglements activated by the
                  work demand that we use history to bridge the geographical
                  distance between Dover and Lampedusa. Brexit does not
                  originate anything new for British art and its institutions
                  that does not already belong to the history of natural
                  extraction and the calculus of life that have defined
                  modernity in the advent of racial capitalism. And while I
                  think about <em>Wake Work</em> and the lives that it
                  commemorates and celebrates, I am reminded of the important
                  difference in English between roots and routes: What
                  transnational coalitions do we allow ourselves to form under
                  the rubric of British art? Whose routes do we want British art
                  to preserve and remember? Can we start to think, as Phoebe
                  Boswell does, of artistic coalitions that engage with
                  histories beyond the history of the nation? British art in the
                  times of Brexit does not need to be defined by nationalism; it
                  can be defined, instead, by the active resistance to that
                  logic.

                <p>
                  If the nation is a fiction made real by psychic investments in
                  images of its cohesion, then Brexit exposes what people who
                  have been subjected to Britain’s imperial forays into the
                  continents designated “dark” have known all along: the image
                  of England coheres around whiteness. Clio Barnard’s film
                  <em>The Arbor</em> (2010) evokes some of the conditions that
                  gave rise to the racism expressed and fueled by Brexit (<a href="#baab-fig6">Fig. 6</a>). Funded by Artangel, which supports artwork that defies the
                  boundaries of genre, <em>The Arbor</em> tells the story of
                  Andrea Dunbar, a young white woman who lived, wrote, and
                  died—prematurely, at the age of 29—on the Buttershaw estate,
                  the notorious housing project in Bradford. Encouraged by a
                  teacher, Dunbar garnered recognition for her skills as a
                  playwright, as she represented the despair of England’s
                  post-industrial wasteland with insightful accuracy. Building
                  on Dunbar’s plays, Barnard’s film attests to the compounded
                  destruction brought about not by foreigners but by a culture
                  of neglect justified by the neoliberal premise that people and
                  places can be abandoned in the name of capitalist prosperity.

                  <em>The Arbor</em> is a documentary, but it is also an artwork
                  that blurs the boundaries between reality and fantasy. It
                  includes footage from an earlier documentary about Dunbar,
                  presents interviews with people in her life, and restages
                  scenes from her plays. The scenes that most stand out are
                  those in which actors lip-sync the testimonies of Dunbar’s
                  children. The slight, Godard-like disconnect between the
                  recordings and the images of the actors on screen creates an
                  uncanny effect that destabilizes the voice as a sign of
                  origin. Laura Mulvey describes these scenes as “bodily
                  palimpsest[s]”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">23</a></sup>
                  The testimony of Lorraine, Dunbar’s half-Pakistani daughter,
                  is the damaged heart of <em>The Arbor</em>. Engulfed by anger
                  and alcoholism, Dunbar neglected all three of her children,
                  but Lorraine was subjected to her mother’s racist assaults,
                  which inscribed her further within an orbit of misery. The
                  portrayal of Lorraine narrating her life begs for a
                  psychoanalytic reading: it reveals the violent words children
                  inherit from their parents and the scars that repeat family
                  narratives with cruel exactitude. Psychoanalysis is also
                  pertinent to the slippage between the voice and the mouth of
                  the actor, Manjinder Virk. Along with Lorraine’s ability to,
                  as Mulvey puts it, “articulate and analyze&nbsp; the most difficult
                  aspects her life”, this slippage opens possibilities for
                  change.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">24</a></sup>
                  Reflecting on her family’s refusal to recognize her as
                  Pakistani, Lorraine declares: “You don’t have to be English to
                  be part of a family”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>The Arbor</em> suggests that the exclusions Lorraine was
                  subjected to within her own her family can be traced to her
                  mother’s fraught place in the racist world of the Buttershaw
                  estate. Barnard recreates a scene from Dunbar’s play, also
                  called <em>The Arbor</em> (1980), in which “the girl” fends
                  off the sexist and racist taunts of young white men who call
                  her a “Dirty Slut” and a “Paki Lover”. Dunbar and Barnard want
                  viewers to see these men articulating the belief that they
                  have a proprietary claim on the girl’s life, body, and love.
                  This belief is made possible by a definition of the white
                  female body as a site for reproducing the fictions of racial
                  stability and the delusions of white superiority. The
                  penultimate scene of <em>The Arbor</em> is footage of Dunbar
                  with Lorraine as a one-year-old infant traveling to London. As
                  she bundles her daughter up, navigates getting her pushchair
                  on to the train, and then wipes the steam from the window so
                  they can look out of it together, viewers see Andrea’s
                  maternal care hinged to her movement into an independent
                  future. The scene is, as Mulvey writes, “unbearably poignant
                  in light of both their future lives”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">25</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Watching the conclusion to <em>The Arbor</em>, I thought of
                  Brexit, but also Sigmund Freud. Narrowly escaping Nazi
                  persecution, the British newspapers described Freud as a “poor
                  refugee” when he arrived in London in 1938. Aided by Princess
                  Marie Bonaparte and Ernest Jones, Freud’s exceptional status
                  saved him. And yet, reading about what Peter Gay describes as
                  the “outpouring of kindness and sympathy” Freud received from
                  “total strangers”, one cannot help but think of an England
                  that Brexit has boarded up and blocked from view.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">26</a></sup>
                  Freud brought with him the concept of the unconscious, as well
                  as ideas and practices for rewriting its collective
                  manifestations through nationalist aggressions. Elizabeth
                  Danto shows that Red Vienna’s experiment in democratic
                  socialism impacted Freud’s thinking, and in 1918 he gave a
                  speech at the Fifth International Congress in Budapest in
                  which he declared that psychoanalysis should be available to
                  the poor. After this declaration, many of its practitioners
                  across Europe thought of psychoanalysis as a social
                  “right”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">27</a></sup>
                  Free psychoanalytic clinics became part of a socialist vision
                  in which healthcare, education, and art were not tools of
                  exclusion but collectively available arenas for cultivating
                  health. What if Dunbar and her daughter had been traveling in
                  the England that welcomed Freud, and in turn, what if Freud
                  had been able to realize the “right to psychoanalysis” on a
                  national scale? Brexit mocks these questions, but
                  <em>The Arbor</em> provokes us to ask them.

                <p>
                  While the architects of Brexit could never have foreseen the
                  calamity of COVID-19, the withdrawal from the European Union
                  will forever be entangled with the pandemic in public memory.
                  Grappling with these inseparable developments, many art
                  historians have recently felt a stronger responsibility to
                  decolonise the discipline, confront whiteness, and undo the
                  tenacity of the nation state as an epistemological framework.
                  Yet, these important intellectual projects, as the editors of
                  <em>British Art Studies</em> have noted, are not new. In our
                  scramble to contend with the interrelated biomedical,
                  economic, and racial crises of today, it behooves us to
                  reconsider a visionary archive of queer Black art, activism,
                  and criticism.

                  One cultural work that remains chillingly relevant is Pratibha
                  Parmar’s video <em>Reframing AIDS</em> (1987) (<a href="#baab-fig7">Fig. 7</a>). At the height of Thatcherism, Parmar—a lesbian feminist
                  Kenyan-born British of Indian descent—insisted that HIV/AIDS
                  was structured by questions of race, gender, immigration, and
                  representation. Analysing the disease, the torrential backlash
                  against queers and people of color, and the emerging
                  infrastructures of care and activism,
                  <em>Reframing AIDS</em> stitched together an array of
                  community and cultural workers across London.

                  Besides giving voice to women, Black people, individuals
                  living with HIV, and artists—that is, those the mainstream
                  media rarely gave the opportunity to speak for themselves—the
                  video carved out a deeper context for understanding the virus
                  as it operated on local, national, and global scales. The
                  feminist activists Susan Ardill and Sue O’Sullivan discuss how
                  the new national safe-sex campaigns completely missed the mark
                  by neglecting women; the Labour politician Ken Livingstone
                  criticised the climate of fear propagated by the government;
                  and HIV-positive gay nurse George Cant shares his mixed
                  experiences of support and discrimination in the NHS.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The HIV/AIDS pandemic fed into and intensified anti-Black
                  racism, immigration control, and the lingering effects of
                  colonialism. Parmar’s film illustrates this through
                  interviews: the art historian and activist Simon Watney cites
                  the fact that the UK and sixteen other countries restricted
                  HIV-positive people from entering, and instituted mandatory
                  testing for high-risk groups; the activist Dorian Jabri points
                  out the rampant Africanization of AIDS in the media, a
                  phenomenon on which the filmmaker Stuart Marshall and the
                  critic Kobena Mercer also elaborate on. In dialogue with Grace
                  Bailey, Mercer draws attention to the problematic cultural
                  associations between the spread of germs and the intermixing
                  of ethnic groups, especially Africans in Europe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To reframe the AIDS crisis and support their vulnerable
                  communities, as Parmar’s video posited and put into practice,
                  cultural agents needed to transform the terms of
                  representation—works of art, video, photography, and criticism
                  were fundamental to AIDS activism. Parmar’s interviews with
                  Sunil Gupta and Isaac Julien, whose respective photo series
                  <em>Exiles</em> (1986) and video
                  <em>This Is Not an AIDS Advertisement</em> (1987) were also
                  featured, likewise reflect this conviction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because national imaginaries dangerously shape viral
                  anxieties, the global perspectives of this brilliant cohort of
                  Black and queer AIDS cultural activists can still offer
                  guidance in the age of Brexit and COVID-19. Particularly as
                  the virus comes under control in the Global North while
                  continuing to wreak havoc on the Global South, we need to
                  devise intersectional activist, scholarly, and creative
                  projects that scrutinise the pandemic through the lens of
                  decolonisation.

                  In May 2021, the Turner Prize announced a list of nominees
                  composed entirely of collectives. According to the jury’s
                  chair, it “captures and reflects the mood of the moment in
                  contemporary British art”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">28</a></sup>
                  The curated list comes in the long aftermath of Brexit and
                  follows two years of disrupted awards. In 2020, the ceremony
                  was cancelled, granting ten artists a £10,000 bursary. In
                  2019, the four nominees split the £40,000 award, reacting to a
                  “political crisis in Britain” by declaring themselves a
                  collective and issuing a joint statement, “in the name of
                  commonality, multiplicity and solidarity”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">29</a></sup>

                  This year’s nominees includes Array, a group that responds to
                  issues disproportionately affecting Northern Ireland including
                  the decriminalisation of abortion and discrimination against
                  queer communities, through performances, protests,
                  exhibitions, and events (<a href="#baab-fig8">Fig. 8</a>);
                  Black Obsidian Sound System, a Queer, Trans, and Intersex
                  Black and People of Colour collective championing sound-system
                  culture across the African diaspora through club nights, art
                  installations, technical workshops, and creative commissions;
                  Cooking Sections, a London-based duo examining the ecological
                  and geopolitical damages of food’s mass-production through

                  While distinct in remit, each collective is localised—produced
                  by specific groups determined by a shared sense of location,
                  dislocation, or identity. They serve particular constituencies
                  while also—in moments of visibility such as the Turner
                  Prize—spotlighting under-recognised topics or challenging
                  discrimination or marginalisation. Each group innovates
                  distinct modes of public engagement, providing advisory or
                  technical services beyond the auspices of participatory art.
                  Discourse and activism are embedded within greater schemes of
                  work, schemes that reach for financing beyond art’s public
                  funding bodies ailing under Conservative austerity.

                  While these praxes may be reflective of a distinctive present,
                  they resemble the integrated practices of the British film
                  workshop movement during the 1960s, later constituted by the
                  “Workshop Declaration” of 1982.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">31</a></sup>
                  Bringing funding, recognition, and audiences to artist and
                  filmmaking collectives, the Workshop Declaration, according to
                  Claire M. Holdsworth, “sowed seeds that pluralised filmmaking
                  in Britain, enabling a generation of innovative alternative
                  filmmakers to make and show work, and convey perspectives not
                  yet seen or heard, to ever wider publics”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">32</a></sup>
                  As well as producing films (of various formats, often
                  broadcast by Channel 4), workshops were required to consider
                  distribution, education, and community access to equipment.
                  Workshops were also committed to racial diversity and local
                  issues—a codified fusion of provision and representation
                  disrupting an otherwise predominantly white, middle-class,
                  metropolitan political and media stronghold. Workshops
                  included the Newcastle-based working-class collective Amber
                  Films;&nbsp;the Black Audio Film Collective and Sankofa, both of
                  which explored Black British identity and culture through
                  film, video, and installation; Retake, Britain’s first
                  all-Asian film and video collective; and the Derry Film and
                  Video Workshop, a women-led company with a focus on women’s
                  experiences in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Workshop Declaration’s financial infrastructure was the
                  result of complex negotiations with a previous Labour
                  government, but came into effect as Britain toiled under
                  Thatcher’s slogan, “There Is No Alternative”. Temporarily it
                  appeared to provide just that—real funding for creativity,
                  solidarity, and production.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">33</a></sup>
                  It supported artists working locally and reparatively, as the
                  state proceeded to govern heavily in the interests of the few.
                  We’re back here now, but while the Turner Prize nominees seem
                  to return to similar focal points and group organising
                  methods, rewards seem tokenistic by comparison to these
                  earlier ventures. No real alternative, no real economy—not
                  yet.

                  In 2017, the Northern Irish artist Rita Duffy collaborated
                  with Catholic and Protestant women living on either side of
                  the Irish border to create <em>Soften the Border</em>, an
                  installation that straddled the geopolitical line running
                  through Belcoo–Blacklion Bridge between County Fermanagh in
                  the United Kingdom and County Cavan in Ireland (<a href="#baab-fig9">Fig. 9</a>). A series of knitted orbs, votive dolls, and disembodied
                  cats’ heads were exhibited over the River Belcoo. Duffy worked
                  with cross-community groups set up with European Union peace
                  funding after 1998; the artwork is a testament to the links
                  and bonds between border peoples that do not map neatly on to
                  national boundaries.

                  Colonised by the Normans (and later the English) from 1169,
                  Ireland was incorporated into a joint kingdom with Britain
                  between 1801 and 1921, when it was partitioned by Westminster.
                  A thirty-year civil war (1968–1998) between loyalists,
                  republicans, and the British state was fought over whether
                  Northern Ireland should remain in the UK or join the Republic
                  of Ireland. During the conflict the border was often a site of
                  violence, and in the 1970s the British Army secretly staged
                  black magic rituals near the border as a form of psychological
                  warfare.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">34</a></sup>
                  The geopolitical boundary line winds through 310 miles of
                  countryside, occasionally splitting farms and even houses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ireland and the UK joined the European Economic Community on
                  the same day in 1973, and the creation of an EU single market
                  in 1993 helped ease some of the border’s economic friction.
                  The majority of voters in Northern Ireland voted to remain in
                  the 2016 EU referendum. The 1998 peace agreement—the Good
                  Friday Agreement—had granted those born in Northern Ireland
                  access to both British and Irish citizenship, a conception of
                  state-sanctioned identity that profoundly jarred the demands
                  of Brexiteers that the UK “take back control” of its borders.
                  The legacy of the conflict and the fragile peace process
                  presented deep problems for those living in Ireland and
                  Northern Ireland, and Northern Ireland’s power-sharing
                  government collapsed in the three years following the
                  referendum. The Irish border also presented serious problems
                  for British politicians pursuing a hard Brexit after 2016.
                  Between 2016 and 2020, journalists and MPs proposed variously
                  that the UK annex Ireland or “starve” the country (which had
                  experienced the Great Famine in 1845–1852).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">35</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before he became prime minister, Boris Johnson underplayed the
                  border issue, criticizing the government for letting it
                  dictate EU exit negotiations, or “allowing the tail to wag the
                  dog”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">36</a></sup>
                  After election to the UK Government’s highest office in 2019,
                  Johnson conceded to the EU’s original proposals for an
                  economic border in the Irish Sea between Britain and Northern
                  Ireland. The latter remains in the EU’s regulatory orbit,
                  giving the former the option to diverge, which has angered
                  some unionists and loyalists. Duffy’s installation on the
                  Belcoo–Blacklion Bridge helped raise the profile of the Irish
                  border during withdrawal negotiations, and reflected on how
                  border peoples have been both profoundly impacted by and also
                  long worked against national boundaries as they shift over
                  time.

                  The UK’s borders, like Britain itself, are neither natural nor
                  atemporal: they are unstable expressions and structures of
                  power, contested and challenged throughout history. The EU
                  referendum and withdrawal negotiations both articulated and
                  exacerbated a profound crisis of British identity, especially
                  in England. Researching art in relation to Britishness means
                  coming into contact or conflict with the power struggles and
                  myths that shape the country’s violent histories.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Artists and art historians making work in relation to Britain
                  have long been complicit with or critical of imperial
                  propaganda. In an attempt to try and justify centuries of
                  oppression and theft, proponents of the British Empire claimed
                  it represented order, progress, civilisation, rationality and
                  modernity. In 1895, the colonial secretary insisted that “the
                  British race is the greatest of governing races the world has
                  ever seen … shown by the success which we have had in
                  administrating vast dominions”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">37</a></sup>
                  These rhetoric strategies sought to rebrand the mass murder
                  and material wealth British society was built on as benevolent
                  custodianship.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">38</a></sup>
                  History as an intellectual discipline in Britain has also long
                  been organised by narratives of linear progress indelibly
                  shaped by empire.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">39</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  While imperialism remains pervasive throughout the UK, it
                  seems possible that the political crises after 2016 caused
                  more people in England to question widely naturalized
                  narratives about Britain’s past and supposed superiority. In
                  this context, Duffy’s votive dolls and occult symbols on the
                  Belcoo–Blacklion Bridge draw on longer histories of
                  supernaturalism across the British Isles to unravel rhetoric
                  of rationality versus irrationality that shaped British
                  imperialism.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">40</a></sup>
                  But even as Brexit supporters likened the UK leaving the EU to
                  Ireland’s violent struggle for independence, the Irish border
                  troubled the image held among British politicians and the
                  press about the nation as a neatly bounded entity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">41</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  One Irish journalist observed that “the ‘peripheral peoples’
                  of the Irish borderlands have been the ghosts at the Brexit
                  feast and their insistence on being heard has radically
                  changed the tenor of English politics”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">42</a></sup>
                  Artworks such as <em>Soften the Border</em> tap into and trace
                  deeper social shifts, revealing the ways in which artists and
                  activists resist the conceptual narratives that have long
                  underpinned normative ideas of Britishness. Any British art
                  history must pay attention to such contestations, to think
                  critically and self-reflexively about the ways in which the
                  discipline is both complicit in or challenges structures of
                  violence and oppression that underpin the UK’s past and
                  present.

                </h1>
                <p>
                  “British art” has been an awkward term for scholars of
                  medieval architecture long before Brexit due to the Kingdom of
                  England’s cultural separation from Scotland since the end of
                  the thirteenth century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">43</a></sup>
                  Even when acknowledging the occupation of Wales as a
                  principality and Ireland as a lordship, “English art” also has
                  unfortunate structural problems in its methods and
                  nomenclature.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">44</a></sup>
                  Formative post-war studies that lay the groundwork, such as
                  the <em>Oxford History of English Art</em>, edited by T. S. R.
                  Boase, Alec Clifton-Taylor’s
                  <em>The Pattern of English Building</em> (1962), and, of
                  course, Nikolaus Pevsner’s
                  <em>The Buildings of England</em> series (first published in
                  1951) could be accused of naively promoting a sense of a
                  prelapsarian vernacular English building, untainted by British
                  imperialism.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">45</a></sup>
                  Consequently, the field of medieval architectural history
                  today—overwhelmingly white and Oxbridge-educated—is complacent
                  about the use of racial terminology, which is arguably more
                  malignant than puerile nationalistic Union-Jack waving.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Early medieval literary studies has long been embroiled in a
                  controversy over the terminology “Anglo-Saxon”, and its use by
                  white supremacists to emphasise Germanic ancestry.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">46</a></sup>
                  Terms that historians often take for granted, such as the
                  “Anglo-Saxon Chronicle”, are most often recently invented
                  labels, and ones that should be open to revision and
                  change.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">47</a></sup>
                  Yet, change in architectural history is unforthcoming.
                  “Anglo-Saxon” is used in the most recent editions of
                  <em>Pevsner Architectural Guides</em> to refer to anything
                  Romanesque that has a pre-Norman style of construction,
                  grouping the mid-eleventh-century tower of Earl’s Barton in
                  Northamptonshire (<a href="#baab-fig10">Fig. 10</a>) in with
                  monuments as diverse in chronology as the Carolingian-period
                  Brixworth church in what would then have been the Kingdom of

                <p>
                  There is another persistent complacency in English medieval
                  architecture studies: a reluctancy to seriously reassess the
                  work of John Hooper Harvey, who was perhaps third only in
                  stature to Pevsner and Clifton-Taylor during the post-war
                  years. This is despite the fact that it has been public
                  knowledge for over a decade now that he was a member of the
                  Imperial Fascist League—the most extreme British fascist party
                  with strong links to Nazi Germany—and the author of vehemently
                  anti-Semitic tracts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">49</a></sup>
                  Immediately after the Second World War, Harvey spent extended
                  spells in Spain, admiring of its “intense conservatism [and]
                  all-pervading feeling of nationality” under Franco.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">50</a></sup>
                  In the late 1970s, he maintained that the Crown court was
                  correct in its 1255 judgement to execute nineteen Jews of
                  Lincoln under accusation of the ritual murder of a young boy,
                  who would be venerated as Little St Hugh under royal
                  approval.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">51</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is not just a case of “separating the art from the artist”
                  with Harvey. Beyond the barely disguised ethno-nationalism and
                  authoritarianism of his survey <em>Gothic England</em> (1947),
                  because of his overbearing belief in the creative genius of
                  individual “great men” (most often called John, as it
                  happens),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">52</a></sup>
                  his apparently forensic approach to dating buildings through
                  documentary analysis is frequently deeply flawed. Chasing a
                  name, Harvey’s scholarship misled Pevsner (and thus
                  generations of readers of the Wiltshire
                  <em>Buildings of England</em>) that Salisbury Cathedral’s
                  iconic spire was built a generation later than it actually
                  was.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53">53</a></sup>
                  Despite his manifest shortcomings as a historian and a person,
                  I still frequently come across his critical judgements held in
                  the highest regard by contemporary writers.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54">54</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Terminologies in medieval architectural history, like public
                  statues, should not be immune from disputation and, if
                  necessary, retirement. I would argue that, rather than marking
                  a turning point, Brexit represents only a continuing
                  reluctance for self-reflection on issues of national identity,
                  not just in the culturally conservative political and punditry
                  establishment, but also in supposedly liberal UK academia. As
                  familiar as the term “Anglo-Saxon” has become when referring
                  to pleasingly ancient structures like the Earl’s Barton tower,
                  correlation of architecture styles with racial bloodlines is
                  irresponsible.

                <p>
                  In September 2017, David Peters Corbett and I asked: “What is
                  the role of art history in the Brexit era?”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55">55</a></sup>
                  A year after the Brexit referendum, it seemed essential to
                  explore how art history could “shed light on the history of
                  Britain’s interaction with other countries and cultures”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56">56</a></sup>
                  Since then, as the editors note in their provocation, the UK
                  government has attempted to set limits on the role of art
                  historians. In 2021, our question takes on a new, more
                  sinister meaning: how is art history being circumscribed in
                  the Brexit era? One way to resist current efforts to
                  depoliticize art history is to expose the ways in which
                  objects have been mobilized to support the agendas of the
                  state.

                  Planned before the United States’ entry into the Second World

                  diplomacy that sought to win American sympathy for the Allies’
                  cause.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58">58</a></sup>
                  The exhibition attempted to reinforce Britain’s “special
                  relationship” with the United States by presenting British
                  craft as a symbol of Western democracy.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59">59</a></sup>

                  As much as <em>Modern British Crafts</em> seemed to affirm the
                  stability of national culture—displaying “jugs in traditional
                  English shapes” and asserting that British crafts had not
                  “greatly changed in character and quality” since opus
                  anglicanum—it also demonstrated how dependent that culture was
                  on international relationships.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61">61</a></sup>
                  Far from strengthening the supposedly unchanging national
                  craft tradition, isolation left British craft struggling to
                  survive. All but a handful of the exhibits had been produced
                  before the war. Craftspeople were redeployed to war work;
                  materials were impossible to obtain because they were being
                  used to make weapons or they could no longer be imported;
                  craft galleries were forced to close; and, even for those few
                  who could continue to practice, the market for their work had
                  shrunk.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn62" id="fnref62">62</a></sup>
                  British craft needed peace to thrive and it needed
                  international consumers to make it sustainable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>Modern British Crafts</em> was organized by the British
                  Council rather than the Ministry of Information because it was
                  not ostensibly political.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn63" id="fnref63">63</a></sup>
                  But numerous supporters on both sides of the Atlantic observed
                  its political value, one claiming that it was “<em>much more valuable than any more direct form of
                    propaganda</em>”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn64" id="fnref64">64</a></sup>
                  Let this be a warning to us. A history of British art that
                  does not constantly critique the concept of Britishness and
                  analyze art’s role in constructing national identity will be
                  “much more valuable” to the state than “any more direct form
                  of propaganda”.

                  <em>A Young Coachman</em>. British (English) School:
                  Interpreting Country House Paintings in a Neo-Nationalist Era
                </h1>
                <p>
                  In 1840, a portrait was painted of a black coachboy, one of
                  two black servants who served at Erddig Hall in North Wales
                  (<a href="#baab-fig12">Fig. 12</a>). The young man is dressed
                  in a red and blue livery. His eyes meet the viewer of his
                  portrait. The National Trust Collections website describes the
                  portrait as British, but this should not detract from the
                  global contexts in which such paintings were produced.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn65" id="fnref65">65</a></sup>
                  William Wilberforce is mentioned in the writing at top right
                  of the painting, which recounts the coachboy’s misfortunes.
                  The painting shows the cultural impact of black and white
                  abolitionists’ campaigns during this period. It reflects a
                  series of national and international conversations about
                  slave-trading, slavery and the apprenticeship system.
                  Apprenticeship was really slavery by another name: the 1833
                  Emancipation Act initially obliged enslaved people to work,
                  unwaged, for an additional eight years. The issue of
                  apprenticeship was resolved just two years before the
                  painting’s completion.

                  The prominence of Emancipation debates during this period
                  provides a useful context for understanding the painting’s
                  resonance at the time. The painting is actually based on a
                  much earlier portrait of a black servant, dated 1770, when
                  slave-trading was at its peak. Although Britain was then mired
                  in the slave-trade, many Britons nonetheless deplored the
                  slavery business, including William Wordsworth, who was born
                  in that same year. Also in 1770, Captain Cook dropped anchor
                  in modern-day Sydney, renaming it Botany Bay and claiming “New
                  South Wales” for Britain. On board his ship was Joseph Banks
                  who had, in Tahiti, spotted the breadfruit. He saw the
                  potential of this as cheap food for enslaved people in the
                  Caribbean. Banks was an advocate of slavery because of its
                  contribution to the British economy. Bank’s attempts at
                  transplanting breadfruit to feed the enslaved in the Caribbean
                  was initially unsuccessful, but other attempts did meet with
                  success. Banks went on to become the unofficial director of
                  Kew Gardens, which became an influential international
                  knowledge and seed-exchange, at the heart of colonial botany.
                  A network of plant hunters sprang up to serve wealthy patrons
                  and gardeners’ nurseries sold expensive “exotic” plants for
                  healthy profits. These sorts of colonial activities had a real
                  bearing on country house estates and portraits of this nature.

                  Paintings depicting black servants, often children, hang in
                  country houses throughout Britain. The 1840 Erdigg portrait is
                  unusual. It depicts the servant as a subject in his own right.
                  More often, African and Indian servants were painted gazing up
                  adoringly at their employers. As Paterson Joseph points
                  out—and David Dabydeen before him—for decades art historians
                  have overlooked the stories of black sitters, which remain
                  largely unresearched and untold.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn66" id="fnref66">66</a></sup>

                  It is a challenge to research and tell these stories in the
                  midst of a “culture war”. This war was declared by a group of
                  fifty-nine MPs and seven Peers, called the Common Sense Group,
                  inspired by the European Research Group, which was influential
                  on Brexit policy.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn67" id="fnref67">67</a></sup>
                  Brexit taught these politicians that nationalism wins votes.
                  The Common Sense Group declared a “culture war” in the summer
                  of 2020. Its leader, Sir John Hayes, repeatedly condemned the
                  National Trust report on its properties’ links to colonialism.
                  He also said that an English Heritage report on the slavery
                  connections of the built heritage “should be shredded”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn68" id="fnref68">68</a></sup>
                  His words typify the group’s openly confrontational tone.

                  The relationship between government and curators has lately
                  come under strain. Curators should—in principle at least—be
                  protected from political interference by the customary
                  government “arm’s-length” principle. Regardless of the current
                  political mood, there remains a body of country house
                  paintings and a wealth of untold stories. It is our duty to
                  tell them, whatever the pressures might be to keep them from
                  view.

                  In the twentieth century artists have clustered with
                  remarkable geographic specificity: St Ives, Norwich, or London
                  have all offered much more meaningful delineations than
                  Britain or England. Even London resists usefulness as a
                  defining territory, easily fragmenting into smaller
                  constituencies: Hampstead in the 1930s was home to what
                  Herbert Read called the “nest of gentle artists”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn69" id="fnref69">69</a></sup>
                  The circle could be smaller still, confined to Parkhill Road,
                  where residents for a brief period included John Cecil
                  Stephenson, John Skeaping, and Piet Mondrian, who lived next
                  door to Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth. Or there is
                  Dalston in the 1980s–1990s, a hub for the Black Audio Film
                  Collective, whose founders, including John Akomfrah and Lina
                  Gopaul, had originally met in Portsmouth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And if such specific groupings are shifting and unstable, what
                  chance is there that something as baggy as nationhood could
                  carry useful definitional meaning? Ian Hamilton Finlay’s
                  Little Sparta offers an array of works pertinent to these
                  questions of geographic distinction, their potency heightened
                  by the vicissitudes of recent politics. In the Pentland Hills
                  outside Edinburgh (which may or may not be British in the
                  future), Little Sparta documents a kind of retreat and
                  insularism, which is offset by the ambition of its imagination
                  and its reach through time. Hamilton Finlay had the advantage
                  that his battle was, at least nominally, with relatively
                  contained entities: Strathclyde local authority and the
                  Scottish Arts Council. But his laconic, occasionally satirical
                  responses fight a long and more universal fight.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Among Little Sparta’s works is <em>The Present Order</em>,
                  conceived in 1983 (<a href="#baab-fig13">Fig. 13</a>)<em>.</em>
                  It is a carving of a quotation by the French revolutionary
                  Louis Antoine Léon de Saint-Just, realised in five iterations
                  during the 1980s, in Dutch, English, French, German, and
                  Italian. Each word of the quotation, “The present order is the
                  disorder of the future” (as it is in English), is carved on a
                  separate stone fragment. If it was not for their weight, their
                  spacing would invite reordering, like magnetic poetry on a
                  fridge door. The work’s historical connotations and many
                  languages connect it to Europe, but each version also belongs
                  to its landscape, its mud and grass. Likewise, the paradox of
                  <em>The Present Order</em>’s own relationship to order.
                  Despite window-dressing suggestive of disorder and
                  variability—the edges of each slab, for instance, would not
                  lock together—the text nevertheless appears in order and fixed
                  in stone. Like much sculpture, it is editioned, following an
                  internal order and the order and conventions of the market.
                  Like many editions, the work is and is not plural, existing as
                  a population of similar but unique objects. Looking at
                  <em>The Present Order</em> from what feels like the disorder
                  of the future, the ambiguities of Hamilton Finlay’s work allow
                  it to be either a consolation or a bittersweet manifesto. It
                  behaves like a ruin battered by time, but all except thirty
                  years of that age is an illusion, a fiction like nationhood
                  itself, and like the future Saint-Just imagined.

                  Sparta was a city state, which (to participate in Hamilton
                  Finlay’s time-travel) might be a description applied by future
                  historians to London. We might wonder what were Sparta’s own
                  Hampsteads and Daltons and what qualities distinguished them
                  to attract artists? Were those qualities Spartan,
                  Peloponnesian, or more broadly dispersed, making the artists
                  feel connected to the world beyond Sparta?

                        Most recently, the British Art Network’s Black British
                        Art Research Group organised a workshop titled “Curating
                        Nation”, inviting artists, curators, and scholars to
                        focus on expanded and more diverse narratives of British
                        art that push the parameters of the nation.&nbsp;The event
                        was led by Alice Correia, Elizabeth Robles, and Marlene
                        Smith, in conversation with Hammad Nasar, curator of

                        In September 2020, the Department for Education
                        prohibited teachers in England from using material
                        created by organisations “that take extreme political
                        stances on matters” such as “a publicly stated desire to
                        abolish or overthrow … capitalism”, notably keeping
                        materials from antiracist groups, such as Black Lives
                        Matter, and environmentalist groups, out of classrooms.
                        See Mattha Busby, “Schools in England Told Not to Use
                        Material from Anti-Capitalist Groups”,
                        <em>The Guardian</em>, 27 September 2020,

Again, in September 2020, the government also
                        instructed arms-length bodies such as museums and
                        galleries to follow its position on contested heritage,
                        which “does not support the removal of statues or other
                        similar objects”. See letter from Oliver Dowden to the
                        Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport, “HM
                        Government Position on Contested Heritage”, File

Most recently, the report from the government’s
                        Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities calls for “all
                        children to reclaim their British heritage” against
                        “negative calls for ‘decolonising’ the curriculum”. See

                        “Islandness” is a concept broadly used (and debated) in
                        contemporary Island Studies to denote a sense of a
                        separate or contained culture and identity. I explore
                        this term in my forthcoming book:

                        Here I am paraphrasing from Christina Sharpe’s
                        discussion of “Black annotation” and “Black redaction”

                        and brutal architectures of state power over Black
                        life;, see Christina Sharpe,

                        <em>The Oxford History of English Art</em> began with a
                        heavy focus on the medieval period. The first instalment
                        was the highly influential Joan Evans,
                        <em>English Art: 1307–1461</em> (Oxford: Clarendon
                        Press, 1949); followed by David Talbot Rice,
                        <em>English Art: 871–1100</em> (Oxford: Clarendon Press,
                        1952); Thomas Sherrer Ross Boase,
                        <em>English Art: 1100–1216</em> (Oxford: Clarendon
                        Press, 1953); and Peter Brieger,
                        <em>English Art: 1216–1307</em> (Oxford: Clarendon
                        Press, 1957). The series concluded with Dennis Farr,
                        <em>English Art 1870–1940</em> (Oxford: Clarendon Press,
                        1978). The projected volumes <em>Up to 871</em> and
                        <em>1461–1553</em> were never produced. See also Alec

                  This feature takes the Slade School of Fine Art as the
                  starting point for a global microhistory and reimagines ways
                  of engaging with, co-constituting, and curating a research
                  archive in pursuit of this endeavour. It consists of two
                  parts: contributions in this issue of
                  <em>British Art Studies</em> focus on the immediate post-war
                  period, roughly 1945 to 1965, and a forthcoming second part
                  will consider the 1960s to the 1990s. In this issue, the
                  feature comprises a narrative history that interrogates the
                  Slade’s role as a contrapuntal node, and a
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives">companion archival feature</a>
                  that brings together materials from multiple institutional and
                  personal archives in Asia and the United Kingdom (UK).
                  Building upon Edward Said’s use of the musical metaphor of
                  contrapuntalism to address both the presence of empire in the
                  metropolis and the construction of a transnational
                  counterpoint with multiple voices, this project seeks to
                  surface histories at the intersection of art education,
                  imperialism, and decolonization. By using the Slade as a
                  transversal line that connects multiple people and histories
                  from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Taiwan,
                  Indonesia, Singapore, Nigeria, Sudan, Uganda, Britain and
                  beyond, this essay proposes new ways of writing histories of
                  contrapuntal—not multiple—modernisms, as well as understanding
                  art in Britain itself as a product of empire.

                <p>
                  The Slade School of Fine Art occupies a complex place in the
                  global history of art education, art practice, empire, and
                  decolonization. The Slade is both an art school and a
                  department of University College London, an abolitionist
                  institution and the first secular university in England.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  From its inception in 1871, the Slade accepted students
                  regardless of race, gender, or religion, and trained students
                  from throughout the British Empire and around the world. As
                  such, it was both an institution of imperial education and a
                  contact zone where imperialism and decolonization existed
                  cheek by jowl, co-constituting the futures of its students,
                  staff, and their networks both in Britain and overseas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the mid-twentieth century, many future artistic and
                  cultural leaders of the postcolonial world would graduate from
                  the Slade. As a result, the Slade is a site of contrapuntal
                  histories that work against the singularity of official
                  imperial narratives, as those who passed through its corridors
                  built new artistic worlds after independence. Indeed, this
                  phenomenon intensified after the end of the Second World War
                  when, with the rise of independence movements throughout Asia
                  and Africa, ambitious students seeking to build new national
                  futures pursued higher education in London and endeavoured to
                  put their learning to decolonial ends. In this context,
                  Britain also began to consider its own post-imperial futures,
                  and imagined itself at the centre of a commonwealth of nations
                  connected through language and culture.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  Between 1950 and 1960, Britain sought to train a “successor
                  generation” of future leaders in newly independent nations,
                  and increased the number of overseas students in the UK from
                  10,000 to 50,000, and the number of such students at the Slade
                  show it was no exception to this pattern.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  Indeed, as a part of the University of London, which had a
                  privileged place in the British university system as the
                  “imperial mother of universities”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>, the Slade received many students sponsored through official
                  government channels, and its administrative records reveal an
                  increasing interest in promoting and accounting for the
                  international character of its student population.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Slade, London, Asia” documents how the Slade functioned
                  during the post-war period (1945–1989), as a site of
                  encounter, decolonization, and exploration for overseas
                  artists, with a particular focus on Asian artists, their
                  networks, and the worlds that they made and imagined, both
                  during and after their time at this art school. It
                  demonstrates how overseas students met the challenges of
                  studying within a system still structured by colonial
                  epistemologies, yet found ways to shape postcolonial futures,
                  define contrapuntal visual vocabularies, and build affective
                  communities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  In many cases, overseas students returned to newly independent
                  nations to establish art programmes that were at once in
                  dialogue with Slade pedagogies and also attuned to local
                  histories, materials, and traditions. A number of these
                  students would create artworks that contributed to the
                  articulation of global modernisms, while others made links
                  through their revolutionary practices between the student
                  movements of the 1960s, decolonization, and the Black Arts
                  Movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although, as an institution, the Slade was not actively
                  imagining ways to create a curriculum designed to accommodate
                  global perspectives, certain conditions created fertile ground
                  for artists from colonized or formerly colonized territories
                  to critically engage with the education that they received,
                  also exposing their fellow classmates and tutors to their
                  evolving perspectives. First, with its overall emphasis on
                  observational practice rather than drawing from antique
                  models, Slade students were not taught to emulate a European
                  past (which was foreign even to British students), but to
                  articulate their own vision.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  Second, the teaching of art history at the Slade, although
                  Eurocentric, was not formalist but contextual, encouraging
                  students to situate themselves critically within it and, in
                  some cases, alongside or against it. Third, the opportunities
                  to meet other overseas artists, to travel, and to engage with
                  London’s global collections (themselves the result of colonial
                  domination) provided a rich, albeit complex, transnational and
                  transcultural environment in which Slade students could think
                  critically and comparatively about their work.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Slade, London, Asia” also provides a model for rethinking
                  discourses of global modernisms, as well as histories of art
                  institutions in Britain. While the “global turn” in art
                  history seeks to overcome the discipline’s methodological
                  nationalism, it has struggled with the tension between
                  producing unifying narratives that lack historical and
                  cultural specificity, and writing context-specific
                  interventions that fail to provide a larger global
                  architecture. This project examines the Slade as a repository
                  of global microhistories that enable both historical precision
                  and theoretical reflection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although the Slade functions here as a site of transcultural
                  entanglement, we self-consciously resist a centring of Slade
                  histories, choosing instead to operationalize the Slade’s
                  institutional archive as a starting point and an initial node
                  from which to write contrapuntal histories of empire and
                  decolonization. In so doing, we are foregrounding a layered
                  reading of Edward Said’s notion of contrapuntalism, which he
                  drew from musicology. In his book
                  <em>Culture and Imperialism</em>, Said advocated re-reading
                  the
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    cultural archive … not univocally, but
                    <em>contrapuntally</em>, with a simultaneous awareness both
                    of the metropolitan history that is narrated and those of
                    other histories against which (and together with which) the
                    dominating discourse acts. In the counterpoint of Western
                    classical music, various themes play off one another, with
                    only a provisional privilege being given to any particular
                    one; yet in the resulting polyphony there is concert and
                    order, an organized interplay that derives from the themes,
                    not from a rigorous melodic or formal principle outside the
                    work.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  That is to say, in this interpretation, a contrapuntal method
                  is used to reveal the role of the colony in imperial centres,
                  revealing those centres as themselves contrapuntal. By reading
                  the colonies back into the centres and their narratives, Said
                  does not just argue for an inclusion of those voices into an
                  imitative fugue, but for a reckoning with colonial pasts from
                  which emerges a new polyphony.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We use this concept to inform our methods, but also to
                  consider the Slade itself as a site, and the artists as agents
                  of contrapuntalism. This last reading is taken from Said’s
                  earlier articulation of the concept in his 1984 essay
                  “Reflections on Exile”*—*the contrapuntal awareness produced
                  by exile, which here we extend to diaspora and migration. Said
                  writes that:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    most people are principally aware of one culture, one
                    setting, one home; exiles are aware of at least two, and
                    this plurality of vision gives an awareness of simultaneous
                    dimensions, an awareness that—to borrow a phrase from music,
                    is <em>contrapuntal.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  More than just a generalized cosmopolitanism, contrapuntalism,
                  as we are using it, is articulated within the context of
                  empire and decolonization.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to theorize contrapuntal modernism as a phenomenon
                  that extended across multiple national contexts rather than as
                  separate, disconnected, “multiple modernisms”, we are
                  introducing the notion of transversals—connecting lines that
                  in Euclidean geometry create equal angles at their points of
                  intersection with parallel lines on the same plane.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                  We trace the histories of artists from multiple decolonizing
                  contexts at corresponding points of intersection in order to
                  draw transversals—geographical (nations, cities, and
                  neighbourhoods), institutional (art schools, universities,
                  government bodies), pedagogical (life drawing, contextual art
                  history), historical (decolonization, racial injustice, and
                  the Black Arts Movement), and aesthetic (modernism, national
                  styles)—that reveal shared conceptual structures and also act
                  as points of connection and relationality. Seemingly disparate
                  contrapuntal histories are made audible as themes in a free
                  counterpoint, to continue Said’s musical metaphor, enabling a
                  polyphonic analysis that goes beyond top–down and bottom–up
                  analyses of global art history. By considering how the
                  histories of artists from different parts of Asia, Africa, and
                  beyond relate to one another in the context of their Slade
                  education, this framework enables transversal comparisons that
                  “bring … into relation terms that have traditionally been
                  pushed apart from each other due to … the European
                  exceptionalism that undergirds Eurocentrism”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  This configuration allows us to write a transcultural history
                  of decolonial modernism that grapples with the history of
                  empire and decolonization, and enables individual figures and
                  national histories, which have generally been understood as
                  isolated from each other in the history of art, to emerge as
                  revelatory of larger historical structures.

                  “Slade, London, Asia” brings together two long-term research

                  The rich digital environment of
                  <em>British Art Studies</em> (<em>BAS</em>) supports this
                  collaborative approach by&nbsp;facilitating the presentation of
                  research as an alchemy of art history, and archival studies
                  and practices. It has enabled us to publish our research
                  across two interlinked formats: the “<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives">Animating the Archive</a>” template, where readers can explore archival materials in a
                  non-linear fashion, and the long-form essay format you see
                  here. The constellation of archival objects, records, and
                  narratives united here, serve to spotlight artists, artworks,
                  and their accounts, in ways that shed light on the many
                  interconnected and parallel histories, visual modalities, and
                  pedagogical frameworks that are traceable through the Slade’s
                  particular transnational context at the intersection of
                  imperial, decolonial, and migration histories. The non-linear
                  aspects of this digital, open-access publication format enable
                  us to activate and make visible unexpected intersections we
                  have encountered in the research. These records, and our
                  activation of them, create threads between geographically
                  disparate archives and histories.

                  “Slade, London, Asia” is built around ten thematic nodes, each
                  encompassing multiple transnational narratives, allowing
                  parallel stories to develop in ways that entangle with other
                  themes and accounts. The features in this issue of
                  <em>BAS</em> are the first in a two-part contribution, with
                  this part focusing on the immediate post-war period, roughly
                  1945–1960. The second part will consider the 1960s to the
                  1990s, and will be published after the “London, Asia, Art,
                  Worlds” conference in May–June 2021, hosted by the Paul Mellon
                  Centre for Studies in British Art (PMC), as well as a series
                  of workshops convened by the PMC and Asia Art Archive (AAA) on
                  art school pedagogies.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Working with archives, we enter into and contribute to a field
                  of power relations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>
                  Archival records provide persistent representations of
                  activities, and are deployed to serve as evidence of action,
                  and support claims about the past.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>
                  Archival logics and practices underpin and are enmeshed with
                  colonial and imperial ontologies and epistemologies, both in
                  the past and in the present.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>
                  Archival studies, which we foreground as co-constitutive of
                  the art histories illuminated here, encourages the telling of
                  “archive stories”, placing value on the narratives of our
                  archival research journeys, and on self-reflexive
                  methodologies.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>
                  Holding these considerations in mind, what then does it mean
                  for us to approach the Slade’s archive looking for overseas
                  students? How can we surface the Slade’s role as a
                  contrapuntal node, linked to other art schools, individuals,
                  and histories in other countries, through student records,
                  photos, oral histories, pages of correspondence, and official
                  records?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout this research, we have sought to read the archive
                  both against and along its grain.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>
                  In our work, student records, supporting an initial
                  biographical approach, provided a necessary entry point. Slade
                  student files are organized by surname, rather than date or
                  country of origin, so we began by consulting the student
                  registers in UCL Records Office, looking for the presence of
                  Asian, African, and Latin American names. This involved moving
                  against the intended logics of the records, attaching new aims
                  to old information. This imperfect methodology was hindered by
                  blind spots for those artists whose names had undergone
                  colonization, such as Colin David from Pakistan and Winston
                  Branch from St Lucia, or those subject to changing conventions
                  of romanization which resulted in multiple spellings and
                  misspellings. We also included British diasporic artists such
                  as Chila Kumari Burman from Liverpool, in order to attend to
                  questions of race and immigration in our study, as well as to
                  probe the intersections between diaspora communities and other
                  global contexts. This growing but tentative list of artists
                  could then be cross-referenced with other documentary sources
                  such as class photos, oral histories, other institutional
                  archives, and published monographs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During this process, we have paid attention not only to the
                  granularity of the individual records, but also to the
                  relationship between records and record types, and the
                  structure, patterns, and constitution of the archive itself.
                  Paper-based archival records are typically arranged according
                  to the principles of provenance and “original order” in order
                  to preserve the relationship between the content of the
                  records and the context that gave rise to them. Like most
                  Western bureaucratic archives, the records of the Slade have
                  been organized and described hierarchically, reflecting the
                  institutional endeavours, priorities, and structures from
                  which the records were generated. In their essence, they
                  privilege the perspective of the administration, the tutors,
                  and directors, as well as those actions undertaken in support
                  of colonial and postcolonial educational projects the college
                  participated in and co-constructed. The records of an art
                  school such as the Slade can then be revelatory not only for
                  the surface informational content inscribed, but also as
                  testament to the specific procedures and actions that reflect
                  larger operations and networks of relations at the
                  intersections of imperial, decolonial, and migration
                  histories. This approach has also helped attune us to the
                  nuanced gestures and experiences of power by which artists
                  were both enabled and constrained, in order to foreground the
                  frictions of global connectivities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this manner, we have sought to engage with the Slade’s
                  institutional archive, that is, not as a fixed or self-evident
                  bank of evidence that can be configured together into some
                  kind of narrative whole. Nor do we present it here with a view
                  towards plugging the gaps in an otherwise linear story.
                  Archives are, as archival theorist Verne Harris notes, only a
                  “sliver of a sliver” of social memory and the documentary
                  record.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">22</a></sup>
                  Moreover, the documentation we have relied on and cultivated
                  is uneven and, like all records, these fragments are never
                  neutral, direct conduits to the past, but rather come to us as
                  selections that have been appraised, arranged, and often
                  rearranged by archivists guided by historically and culturally
                  situated archival theory and practices.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">23</a></sup>
                  Here, through our mediation, they are further displaced from
                  their particular context of creation, and configured into
                  contingent scholarly “animations”, in a context in which
                  archival source material is increasingly circulating as
                  digitally searchable, disintermediated entities, unbound by
                  real-world geographies and national borders that would have
                  previously grounded our research journeys.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">24</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rather, we understand ourselves as co-constituting and
                  reimagining the archive to create new potential histories.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">25</a></sup>
                  We began with a view to understanding the art school as a
                  literal contact zone for artists mediating contrapuntal
                  histories of London and Asia. Throughout this feature, we have
                  indicated the years of study for those artists who attended
                  the Slade in order to articulate the art school as a
                  transversal node and, additionally, to draw attention to
                  connections between artists that may not be directly addressed
                  in this feature. Yet, in the process, we also generated an
                  archival contact zone in the form of a digitally collaborative
                  site and an ever-evolving repository of names, places, and
                  data points, which stretches far beyond the Slade and
                  highlights an unwieldy and always contingent network of
                  entanglements. The construction of this parallel research
                  “archive” has necessitated an ongoing reassessment of its
                  scope: these collated materials continue to exist dynamically
                  in dialogue with other archives, and related archival
                  pursuits. The research journey has to date led us to an array
                  of personal, family, institutional, and organizational
                  archives (both formal and informal), as well as oral histories
                  and workshops that extend well beyond the Slade’s
                  repositories, and which defy the clear parameters of “London,
                  Asia”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">26</a></sup>
                  This expansive and iterative approach has surfaced important
                  alignments and transversals that extend beyond Asia, taking us
                  to parts of Africa—to Egypt, Nigeria, Sudan, and Uganda. As
                  the contours of this archive are continually re-envisioned, we
                  embrace the knowledge that archives, archival records, and the
                  pluralistic, “archival multiverse” in which we participate,
                  are always in the process of becoming.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">27</a></sup>

                <h3>Slade Class Photos: Animating Sites and Networks</h3>
                <p>
                  Every spring since the 1930s, a panoramic class photo has been
                  taken on the lawn outside the Slade, located in the central
                  quadrangle of UCL’s campus in London. These images provided a
                  springboard by which to animate the archive, inviting us to
                  consider—and complicate—the Slade as an artistic, pedagogical,
                  and institutional site and contact zone through which artists
                  have moved, leaving a documentary trail of those journeys
                  behind them.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">28</a></sup>
                  In these photographs, we can locate artists in the same art
                  school at a particular moment in time, hinting at possible
                  convergences and synergies between them. The 1955 class photo,
                  for instance, includes Ibrahim El-Salahi (1954–1957), A.M. El
                  din Guinead (1954–1957), Menhat Helmy (1952–1955), Khalid
                  Iqbal (1952–1955), Sam Ntiro (1952–1955), Tseng Yu
                  (1952–1956), and Jamila Zafar (1954–1957) (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-3">Fig.&nbsp;1</a>). In 1957, we see Kulwant Aurora (1955–1958; 1964–1967),
                  D.J. Banerjee (1956–1959), A.M. El Guneid [Abdullahi
                  Al-Guneid], Ibrahim El-Salahi, Anwar Jalal Shemza (1956–1960),
                  Phan van My (1955–1957), Wendy Yeo (1953; 1955–1959), and
                  Jamila Zafar (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-3">Fig.&nbsp;2</a>). Three years later, sitters include: Amir Nour (1959–1962),
                  Archana Lahiri (1959–1960), Shama Zaidi (1959–1960), Chengkim
                  Lim (Kim Lim) (1957–1960; 1969–1970), Damyanti Chowla
                  (1957–1960), Gnanasundari Swaminathan (1958–1962), A. Rahim
                  (1959–1962), and Anwar Jalal Shemza and Maisie Tschang
                  (1959–1963) (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-3">Fig.&nbsp;3</a>). Yet, these are misleading representations; we know that
                  not all who studied or passed through the Slade posed for
                  these photographs. We also know that life models often joined
                  in and, on occasion, guests made appearances, such as Sam
                  Ntiro, along with his wife Sarah Nyendwoha Ntiro, who in 1960,
                  sat as a visiting alumnus. We know too that visiting artists
                  such as Affandi (1952) (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-13">Fig.&nbsp;24</a>) and Zainul Abedin (1951–1952) (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-13">Fig.&nbsp;25</a>) passed through the Slade, and the documentation by which we
                  have located them is more informal, unofficial, and often
                  serendipitously encountered, defying any easy configurations
                  of its transnational networks.

                  Slade Administrative Records and the Art School as
                  Intermediary
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Slade student files typically include an entry form and
                  photograph (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-4">Figs.&nbsp;4–6</a>), information on courses taken and focus of study, reports
                  from tutors, change of address forms, reference letters, and,
                  on occasion, exhibition catalogues or press clippings. For
                  those students coming from overseas, the documents often
                  highlight the care offered by Slade staff, who liaised between
                  students, the authorities, and their families abroad, who were
                  often anxious for reassurances. William Townsend and Slade
                  Secretary and Tutor Ian Tregarthen Jenkin, for instance,
                  emerge as important advisors to international students,
                  helping them settle into new terrain, sourcing accommodation,
                  putting in a good word, or even directly managing students’
                  wayward finances. At its best, this pastoral role is accented
                  by a sense of collegiality, with students addressed as fellow
                  artists. In some files, we are privy to correspondence between
                  students and their tutors, with comments on exhibitions seen
                  and critiqued, artworks created, and directions pursued, and
                  peppered with gossip and news of others. Such exchanges often
                  continued years after students had departed the Slade.

                  Yet equally, the documents within these files will have been
                  coded or crafted to convey certain pieces of information
                  towards particular aims. Tutors’ reports, for instance, were
                  designed as an internal tool for staff to address students’
                  areas of activity and any issues encountered, and advise on
                  future directions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">29</a></sup>
                  Overall, they capture moments of assessment and judgements of
                  a student’s progress and capability, which, while useful for
                  the future writing of reference letters, also convey
                  information in other registers. The tone of these reports is,
                  unsurprisingly, often characterized by colonial-era phrasing
                  and perspective. A tutor’s report for Wendy Yeo, dated 1957,
                  and penned by Sam (B.A.R.) Carter, notes: “Original and
                  gifted. Finds it hard to paint in front of the subject. Local
                  colour distracts her. She employs the Chinese approach.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">30</a></sup>
                  In the oral history interview conducted for this project, Yeo
                  responded to Carter’s comments with some surprise. For her,
                  the period of study at the Slade was characterized by her
                  adopting what she described as a Western style. It was only on
                  her return to Hong Kong, at the end of her studies in late
                  1960, that Yeo began to consciously foreground her knowledge
                  of ink painting practices within the European approaches she
                  had refined through her Slade training.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">31</a></sup>
                  It remains unclear to what extent&nbsp;the written notes reflect
                  direct observations made by the tutor, or conversation points
                  in which Yeo would have presented these as dilemmas
                  encountered, but what is clear is that her practice was being
                  considered as one at the intersection of different cultural
                  traditions.

                  The Sudanese artist and film-maker Hussein Shariffe’s
                  (1957–1959) student file gives an impression of his particular
                  disposition and circumstances. A tutor’s report, dated 5 March
                  1958, reads, “Bad lecture record, bad attendance record, v.
                  good drawings—an artist—most interesting chap” (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-5">Fig.&nbsp;7</a>). This document, in context with the assemblage of
                  documentary fragments that make up his student file, including
                  frequent change of address forms, reflects the story of an
                  often absent and restless artist whose orientation was as much
                  outside of the Slade as within it. His academic
                  pathway—initially modern history at Cambridge, followed by a
                  brief period of studying architecture at the University of
                  Sheffield—is indicative of the transdisciplinary explorations
                  that would come to infuse his artistic practice, encompassing
                  painting, poetry, and film, bridging both documentary and
                  fiction.
                </p>

                  The chronological accumulation of administrative files outline
                  contact between artist and art school in ways that begin to
                  illuminate the network of relations that are at once
                  institutional, interpersonal, structural, and chronological,
                  and that span well beyond the site and period of study. Within
                  the file, we also find an exhibition brochure from&nbsp;Shariffe's
                  third solo exhibition at Gallery One in 1963 (the first two
                  were held in 1959 and 1960), with a photograph of&nbsp;him on the
                  cover (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-5">Fig.&nbsp;8</a>), likely taken by Ida Kar whose other images of Shariffe
                  were acquired by the National Portrait Gallery.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">32</a></sup>
                  Another document reveals how, over a decade after leaving the
                  Slade, when Shariffe was Head at the State Corporation for
                  Cinema in Khartoum, he also wrote to Ian Tregarthen Jenkin in
                  1971, asking his advice on applying to the UK’s newly
                  established National Film and Television School (NFTS) in
                  Beaconsfield (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-5">Fig.&nbsp;9</a>). Shariffe’s growing interest in film captured in this
                  document was fortuitous: in 1972, he was invited by his
                  friend, colleague, and fellow Slade graduate Ibrahim
                  El-Salahi, then Director of the Sudanese Ministry of Culture
                  and Information, to head the ministry’s cinema department.
                  There, Shariffe would direct his first film, an experimental
                  documentary <em>The Throwing of Fire</em> (1973). After
                  leaving the ministry, Shariffe returned to the UK to attend
                  the NFTS, where he directed two films:
                  <em>The Dislocation of Amber</em> (1975) about the Sudanese
                  port of Suakin and its colonial history; and
                  <em>Tigers Are Better Looking</em> (1979), an adaptation of a
                  short story by Jean Rhys in which Shariffe counterposes poetic
                  documentary scenes of Sudan with Great Britain as sites of
                  colonialism, exile, racism, and cultural insularity.

                  Student records also make plain the role of governmental
                  agencies through grants and scholarships. We know that Jawad
                  Selim (1946–1949) came to the Slade through an Iraqi
                  government grant; Krishna Reddy (1951–1952) received an Indian
                  government scholarship; Menhat Helmy was supported by the
                  Egyptian Ministry of Education; while both Abdullahi Al-Guneid
                  [A.M. El Guneid] and Ibrahim El-Salahi received grants from
                  the Sudanese Ministry of Education. Vivan Sundaram (1966–1969)
                  received a Commonwealth Scholarship, and Naazish Ataullah
                  (1984–1985), Colin David (1961–1962), Sam Ntiro, Anwar Jalal
                  Shemza, Gazbia Sirry (1954–1955), K.G. Subramanyan
                  (1955–1956), and Damrong Wong-Uparaj (1962–1963) were all
                  funded by the British Council.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">33</a></sup>
                  Such channels are, of course, not benign. The British
                  Council’s founding aims, articulated in 1936, read,
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    [to] promote abroad a wider appreciation of British culture
                    and civilisation, by encouraging the study and use of the
                    English language, and thereby, to extend a knowledge of
                    British literature and of the British contributions to music
                    and the fine arts, the sciences, philosophical thought and
                    political practice.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">34</a></sup>

                <p>
                  In short, their aims were to promote British interests through
                  soft diplomacy and the assertion of cultural and linguistic
                  power. From an educational perspective, the British Council
                  positioned itself as an enabler of “the free flow of students
                  from overseas to British seats of learning … and of United
                  Kingdom students in the reverse direction”. Indeed, within the
                  context of decolonization and the Cold War, the British
                  Council played a key role in Britain’s post-imperial futures,
                  seeking “to provide opportunities for maintaining and
                  strengthening the bonds of the British cultural tradition
                  throughout the self-governing Dominions. To ensure continuity
                  of British education in the Crown Colonies and
                  Dependencies”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">35</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  While these files convey artists as biographical subjects,
                  they also foreground artistic figures as institutional
                  subjects, in which the Slade functions as an authoritative
                  intermediary. Junctures in students’ lives are captured
                  through administrative transactions, leaving documents that
                  shed light on the wider colonial and postcolonial bureaucratic
                  systems that fostered and influenced—but also
                  restricted—individual and artistic endeavours. Reports to and
                  from the Home Office in a number of student files remind us
                  how the Slade, like all institutions of higher education,
                  functioned as a literal gateway to London. Anxious letters and
                  telegrams about arrival dates and securing visas show the
                  mediation of patrician bureaucracies of foreign embassies and
                  high commissions who dictated the terms of a student’s stay in
                  Britain, or the release of funds for further study. In a
                  report to the British Council on Egyptian artist Gazbia Sirry,
                  written by William Townsend in 1955, Townsend weighs in on the
                  value of the British Council extending her scholarship for
                  further postgraduate study at the Slade (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-6">Figs.&nbsp;10 and 11</a>). He notes that as an established artist who has “a fully
                  formed style of her own”, the chief benefit of the Slade for
                  Sirry was not the tuition, but rather how it provided her with
                  a “centre where she has met other artists”. However, he notes,
                  she has “reached a stage where full-time attendance at an art
                  school is of little value to her. She requires only occasional
                  contact with artists who can give advice, together with
                  facilities for lithography”. In the end, her scholarship was
                  not extended.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Such snippets of complex stories render the artist as subject,
                  rather than author of the records, so we hear nothing
                  of&nbsp;Sirry's perception on these events. By the same token,&nbsp;such
                  records do often illuminate institutional thinking. A letter
                  to the Aliens Department of the UK Home Office, dated 1952,
                  requests visa authorization for prospective student Tseng Yu
                  (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-6">Figs.&nbsp;12 and 13</a>). The letter is a gesture of persuasive bureaucracy, penned
                  by Tregarthen Jenkin:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    It is of very great advantage to us, and to all working at
                    this school, to have a number of overseas students here to
                    instil a new outlook and possibly to bring unusual styles of
                    work to the school. As this school is well known throughout
                    the world, we are constantly getting applications for
                    admission from overseas and we believe that Mr. Tseng Yu
                    would probably benefit more by being admitted as a student
                    here than he would by studying at one of his local
                    institutions.

                  While this document testifies to immigration policies and
                  national boundaries, it is also a statement of institutional
                  position, situating the Slade as a contact point, and site of
                  cross-cultural exchange, both benefiting from the presence of
                  overseas students, and being of benefit to foreign artists as
                  a cosmopolitan site bestowing global access, influence, and
                  prestige.

                <h3>Records of Play and Postcolonial Fields</h3>
                <p>
                  Alongside routine administrative tasks, archival records are
                  also generated through other imperatives, such as the drive to
                  document social events. An evocative example, accented with an
                  overt interest in creating an art-historical record, is an
                  autographed cricket bat found in the Slade archive, signed by
                  the players of a friendly game between staff and students of
                  the Slade and Camberwell College of Art in the summer of 1954
                  (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-7">Figs.&nbsp;14–16</a>). Signatories include William Coldstream, Barry Daniels,
                  Khalid Iqbal, Myles Murphy, Claude Rogers, and William
                  Townsend. Framed for perpetuity, the object captures a
                  self-conscious moment of artistic sociality between two London
                  art schools whose relationship is well established in British
                  national art histories. At the time, Khalid Iqbal was a
                  student at the Slade whose admission to the school had been
                  facilitated “as a special case” through institutional networks
                  with the University of the Punjab, Lahore (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-8">Figs.&nbsp;17–19</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">36</a></sup>
                  Yet the presence of Iqbal’s signature in particular asks us to
                  reconsider the dynamics of this exchange and its milieu: a
                  game which enables colonial power relations to be subverted,
                  here played at an intersection of postcolonial artistic
                  networks.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">37</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This record, emerging out of an extracurricular activity and
                  invested with archival significance not through bureaucracy
                  but through ritual and sociality, nonetheless prompted a new
                  pathway of research. Our inquiry about Iqbal resurfaced
                  long-standing networks linking the Slade and the National
                  College of Arts, Lahore (NCA), where Iqbal would go on to
                  teach after his time at the Slade (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-8">Figs. 20</a>
                  and
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-9">21</a>). In his 2013 oral history interview, Slade alumnus (and
                  later Slade archivist) Stephen Chaplin recalls befriending
                  Iqbal on their first day in the Slade Antiques Room in the
                  autumn of 1952, noting how Iqbal sought to “paint the Indian
                  countryside as an Impressionist” (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-10">Fig.&nbsp;22</a>). Demonstrating the intergenerational entanglements between
                  Slade printmaking and NCA, Chaplin later related this story to
                  another NCA alumnus in the 1990s, who confirmed that, indeed,
                  Iqbal had become a professor at NCA after his time at the
                  Slade. Such exchanges around a singular individual illuminate
                  the Slade as one node set in relation to others along parallel
                  and transversal trajectories connecting across generations.
                  Shakir Ali (1946–1949), Colin David, Jamila Zaidi (née Zafar),
                  and Khalid Iqbal all spent time at both the NCA and Slade.
                  They taught Naazish Ataullah and Afshar Malik (1986–1988), who
                  followed in their footsteps at the Slade, and in turn taught
                  current NCA professors Laila Rahman (1991–1993) and Ali Kazim
                  (2009–2011), both also Slade graduates.

                  The end of the Second World War brought a wave of
                  decolonization and the rise of independence movements in Asia
                  and throughout the former British Empire. Indonesia became
                  independent in 1945; India and Pakistan were partitioned in
                  1947, with Bangladesh achieving independence in 1971; Burma
                  and Ceylon became independent in 1948, Malaya in 1957,
                  Singapore in 1965; and Hong Kong passed from British to
                  Chinese control in 1997. Many of these newly independent, or
                  soon to be independent, nations began to shape what Frantz
                  Fanon later characterized as “national culture”, or the
                  creation of postcolonial cultures that sought liberation from
                  the “colonialist theory of pre-colonial barbarism”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">38</a></sup>
                  A key aspect of this postcolonial nation-building was the
                  creation of national education systems, including for the
                  arts, which was understood as a means of giving shape to
                  national culture. At this moment of hope and new beginnings,
                  many artists availed themselves of the opportunities for
                  training and funding provided by their own governments and by
                  the British government, via the British Council. Although it
                  may seem contradictory to seek training in the colonial
                  capital for postcolonial objectives, this tension points to
                  the ways in which processes of cultural self-determination
                  were themselves contrapuntal. Identifying the transversals
                  that connect moments in postcolonial histories to each other
                  and to Britain enables historians to productively analyse
                  parallels and intersections in the articulation of national
                  styles and national curricula in multiple and seemingly
                  disconnected sites.

                  The documents presented in this section enable us to grasp the
                  different visions for postcolonial artists and cultural
                  education held by figures who were at once not only artists,
                  but also bureaucrats, arts administrators, and key members of
                  government. Many of these artists were mid-career when they
                  arrived at the Slade, and did not necessarily complete an
                  entire degree, as study abroad was often regarded as
                  endogenous development by newly independent nations, and
                  capacity building for those same nations by the British
                  government. As such, art training at the Slade was perceived
                  as serving a larger purpose beyond personal artistic
                  development, be it on the level of teacher training, or
                  building expertise in cultural and educational policy. This
                  was certainly the case for Zainul Abedin, who was already the
                  principal of what was then called the Government Institute of
                  Arts, Dacca when he went to the Slade from 1951 to 1952, a
                  visit profiled by the magazine <em>Commonwealth Today</em> (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-12">Fig.&nbsp;23</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">39</a></sup>
                  Khalid Iqbal was admitted to the Slade in 1952 after Anna
                  Molka Ahmed, the department head at the University of the
                  Punjab, Lahore, wrote to Tregarthen Jenkin to request help
                  training more faculty for the university (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-9">Fig. 21</a>). Similarly, K.G. Subramanyan was already an established
                  artist and teacher at the Faculty of Fine Arts at the Maharaja
                  Sayajirao University of Baroda, which had been created as a
                  “postcolonial corrective to the problem of art education in
                  India”, when he attended the Slade from 1955 to 1956.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">40</a></sup>
                  Others, such as Affandi from Indonesia, merely passed through
                  the Slade on larger tours of European institutions in an
                  effort to gather information for the establishment of arts
                  infrastructure, and were supported at a political level in
                  their countries of origin. This is particularly evident in the
                  case of Affandi, whose travel from India to London was
                  facilitated by a letter written in 1947 from Sukarno, the
                  post-independence president of Indonesia, to Jawaharlal Nehru,
                  the post-independence prime minister of India (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-13">Fig.&nbsp;24</a>). Indeed, an article in <em>The Diplomatist</em> linking
                  Affandi and Abedin’s work demonstrates the diplomatic pathways
                  that these two artists travelled, as well as the artistic
                  resonances between their work (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-13">Fig.&nbsp;25</a>).

                <p>
                  The formation of postcolonial cultures and art education
                  practices entailed a variety of different responses to
                  colonial art education, which was also not uniformly
                  implemented across the empire. Although it varied from colony
                  to colony, from school to school, and from period to period,
                  art education under British colonialism consistently reflected
                  a tension between its “civilizing mission”, which sought to
                  disseminate the values, hierarchies, and aesthetic principles
                  of the European tradition of fine art on the one hand, and on
                  the other hand, to strengthen local visual practices, be it
                  for the purposes of developing art industry, as in colonial
                  India, or as salvage anthropology, as in East Africa, or as a
                  means of “saving” Chinese culture from the threat of
                  communism, as in late colonial Hong Kong.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">41</a></sup>
                  These latter tendencies were also filtered through the
                  discourses of Orientalism in Asia and North Africa, and
                  Primitivism in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite significant local
                  variations, the colonial education system thus hinged on one
                  particular distinction (or transversal) that played out in
                  different ways across the empire: the distinction between
                  “fine art”, which was coded as Western; and local practices,
                  which were coded as “craft”, applied art, or industrial art.
                  This distinction, repeated across the empire, materialized
                  ideological hierarchies between colonizer and colonized.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the case of colonial India, four art schools were
                  established in the four main colonial cities under the East
                  India Company in order to provide training in mechanical and
                  vocational skills: The Calcutta School of Art (est. 1854), the
                  Industrial School of Arts in Madras (est. 1854), the Sir
                  Jamsetji Jeejibhoy School of Art, Bombay (J.J. School of Art,
                  est. 1857), and the Mayo School of Arts, Lahore (est., 1875).
                  After the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 and the assertion of British
                  governmental control through the Government of India Act in
                  1858, which established the British Raj, the Crown assumed
                  control of the schools and reorganized their curricula. At
                  this point, European hierarchies of fine art and craft were
                  more systematically embedded into the educational system.
                  There was thus a split, and the Calcutta School of Art and the
                  J.J. School of Art took on training as “schools of art”, and
                  the Mayo School of Arts and the Industrial School of Arts in
                  Madras trained students in the <em>arts</em>, with a focus on
                  developing local art industries. As Partha Mitter argues, this
                  dual-track system created two separate realms, with the
                  superiority of fine art, defined as Western, clearly
                  articulated.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">42</a></sup>

                <p>
                  At the beginning of the twentieth century, as Tapati
                  Guha-Thakurta argues, a group that included anti-colonial
                  nationalist Abanindranath Tagore, Orientalists E.B. Havell,
                  A.K. Coomaraswamy, Sister Nivedita, and pan-Asian advocate
                  Okakura Tenshin, reversed those hierarchies in a discourse
                  that operated at the intersections of Orientalism and Hindu
                  nationalism to define and foster the Bengal School at the
                  Calcutta School of Art, and later at the Kala-Bhavan art
                  school at Santiniketan.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">43</a></sup>
                  As Sonal Khullar points out, however, this gesture ironically
                  maintained European epistemologies by preserving the
                  separation between East and West, art and craft.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">44</a></sup>
                  Partly in response to Bengal School nationalism, as Simone
                  Wille argues, a Muslim cultural space also began to be defined
                  in Pakistan. Not directly associated with political
                  nationalism, however, it operated at a slight distance from
                  Pakistani nationalism, itself an ambivalent concept,
                  particularly for artists such as Zainul Abedin from East
                  Pakistan, which became Bangladesh in 1971.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">45</a></sup>

                <p>
                  For artists imagining postcolonial states in the post-war
                  period, the challenge thus entailed defining new relationships
                  between practices that had been coded as separate while
                  simultaneously making claims on both modernity and locational
                  identity in the context of new independence struggles (as, for
                  example, in the case of Bangladesh), and the competing
                  cultural patronage spheres of the Cold War. The case studies
                  in this section provide lenses through which to see how the
                  Slade became a contrapuntal site where diverse postcolonial
                  modernisms were articulated and contributed to an artistic and
                  discursive ecosystem.

                <h3>
                  Zainul Abedin and the Government Institute of Fine Arts, Dhaka
                </h3>
                <p>
                  On the eve of partition, creating an art school in East Bengal
                  became a priority, as it became clear that the three
                  institutions which had been shaping the Bengali art world
                  would be located in India: the Calcutta Art School,
                  Kala-Bhavana of Santiniketan, and the Indian Society of
                  Oriental Art. Abedin and a group of Bengali Muslim teaching
                  staff from the Calcutta Art School thus founded the Government
                  Institute of Fine Arts, Dhaka in 1948.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">46</a></sup>
                  Abedin’s work as a cultural bureaucrat, for which he had been
                  rewarded with the position of Head Artist of the Information
                  Ministry of the Central Government in Karachi, led to him
                  undertaking a “cultural tour” funded by the Government of
                  Pakistan, which included a period of study at the Slade from
                  1951 to 1952 (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-12">Fig.&nbsp;23</a>). During that trip, he also travelled around Europe and the
                  Middle East, and attended a UNESCO-sponsored conference in
                  Venice on the role of the Modern Artist in Society.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">47</a></sup>
                  Indeed, as a quintessential artist-bureaucrat, Abedin would
                  have many opportunities for travel during his career, with a
                  twelve-month long trip to Japan, the USA, Canada, Mexico, and
                  Europe sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation (1956–1957) as
                  well as a visit to the USSR at the invitation of the Soviet
                  government, where he was honoured with a gold medal (1961).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Zainul Abedin’s notes on cultural policy from the 1960s, a
                  draft perhaps written for the purposes of delivering a lecture
                  or chairing a meeting, enables us to see a snapshot of his
                  vision for a national culture, which at that time still
                  included East and West Pakistan (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-13">Fig.&nbsp;26</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">48</a></sup>
                  These notes set out a plan that encompassed both public arts
                  institutions and education, as well as an ambition to present
                  “different artefacts relating to Fine Arts, such as Folk Art
                  and Crafts, Drawing and Paintings, Music, Drama and Dance, and
                  so on, as well as the aims and implications of each subject”.
                  In other words, although he does not advocate for a
                  Bauhaus-style integration of Arts and Crafts, Abedin stressed
                  relationalities between them. Indeed, as Lala Rukh Selim
                  argues, for Abedin, Bengali folk heritage was a means of
                  developing a collective identity that was common to the
                  multiple religious communities living in Bengal, as opposed to
                  the Muslim Mughal miniatures being advocated for in East
                  Pakistan.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">49</a></sup>
                  Education plays a central role for Abedin, not just at the
                  professional level, but from the primary school level all the
                  way up to university and art schools, as well as in the public
                  sphere. In his notes, he advocates both for museum collections
                  of “our well known painters’ work in galleries (preferably
                  attached to universities)” and “research work, to set up folk
                  museums in cities of both wings”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">50</a></sup>
                  Here, it is important to note his desire to establish folk
                  museums in “cities of both wings”, indicating both his
                  professional commitment to a Pakistani national culture, as
                  well as a specific Bengali cultural sphere. This thought would
                  metamorphose into his establishment of the Sonargaon Folk Art
                  and Craft Museum containing objects of Bengali origin outside
                  of Dhaka in 1975, just four years after Bangladeshi
                  independence.

                  Lahore
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Shortly after she was hired as a faculty member at the
                  National College of Arts, Lahore (NCA), Jamila Zaidi (née
                  Zafar) was recruited to serve on the Pakistani national
                  committee which determined secondary school curricula, and
                  also to write a textbook for secondary school education in
                  1961 (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-40">Fig. 78</a>). In the documents collected here, we see both how the
                  project of writing a textbook is framed by the chairman of the
                  Board of Secondary Education as being of “national importance”
                  (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-14">Figs.&nbsp;27 and 28</a>) and how Zaidi responds by writing that “the undersigned has
                  no objection to undertaking this in the national interest” (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-14">Figs.&nbsp;29 and 30</a>). As a result of this commission, Zaidi was accorded special
                  permission to travel to India on a study tour of historical
                  monuments of India (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-14">Fig.&nbsp;31</a>). As is discussed in the “Contrapuntal Pedagogies” section
                  of this feature, Zaidi introduced art and craft into the
                  national secondary school curricula as well as at the NCA,
                  departing from British colonial ideas of art and craft as
                  separate. Zaidi’s thinking was developed at the intersection
                  of post-independence nationalist ideas about culture; the
                  NCA’s own history of being a school for the development of
                  handicrafts and art industry; the Bauhaus-inspired context set
                  by the first NCA principal American artist Mark Ritter
                  Sponenburgh; and her own training, both at Punjab University
                  and at the Slade.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">51</a></sup>
                  Engaging with both Sponenburgh’s craft-oriented paradigm and
                  the Slade curriculum, Zaidi formulated a third path “in the
                  national interest”, which charted a direction between art and
                  craft. By doing so, Zaidi started off a process of
                  postcolonial imagining in the curriculum that, although
                  uneven, would have significant ramifications for future
                  generations of artists and teachers both at the secondary
                  level and at the NCA.

                <h3>K.G. Subramanyan and Art Education in India</h3>
                <p>
                  Although written retrospectively in 1997, K.G. Subramanyan’s
                  “An Unfinished Agenda (Some Thoughts on Art Education in
                  India)”, provides some insight into how Subramanyan approached
                  the question of imagining postcolonial states, as well as his
                  attitudes about education (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-15">Fig.&nbsp;32</a>). A Gandhian in his youth who was arrested for his
                  nationalist activities in the Quit India movement in 1943, a
                  student at Rabindranath Tagore’s nationalist art school in
                  Santiniketan, and a young professor at the Faculty of Fine
                  Arts at the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda,
                  Subramanyan arrived at the Slade in 1955 with a strong sense
                  of self based in nationalist discourses, both politically and
                  aesthetically. Subramanyan’s nationalism was not, however, an
                  essentialist nationalism but one that, developed through the
                  worldly environments of Santiniketan and Baroda, was informed
                  by Chinese and Japanese aesthetics, as well as the history of
                  art in India and Europe.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">52</a></sup>
                  Indeed, the principle of openness to change, to prevent
                  cultural stagnation by nurturing “critical dissent and
                  innovation” was central to Subramanyan. In his “agenda”, he
                  criticizes colonial mindsets that “ingrained in us certain
                  stereotypical notions about our <em>antecedents,</em> as well
                  as <em>progress</em> and <em>change</em>” (emphasis in
                  original). He continues, taking a critical perspective on
                  nationalist culture that was nurtured at the intersection of
                  Orientalism and nationalism, writing, “Our picture of our
                  antecedents harks back to a mythical golden age, and sticks
                  together various highlights of our culture into a flamboyant
                  collage. Our picture of progress corresponds to what is
                  currently in vogue in the West.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53">53</a></sup>
                  The framework for postcolonial cultural identity that he
                  developed was characterized by what Sonal Khullar has coined
                  “worldly affiliations”, exemplified by dynamic exchanges
                  rather than unchanging essences.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54">54</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As Siva Kumar Raman argues, Subramanyan utilized his time at
                  the Slade as a research student to critically engage with the
                  Slade’s intellectual, technical, and aesthetic offerings.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55">55</a></sup>
                  Not interested in the type of painting that was being done at
                  the Slade, Subramanyan made a choice that was surprisingly
                  common for overseas students—to enter into the printmaking
                  department. There, he became close with Anthony Gross, Victor
                  Pasmore, and Ceri Richards. He also created work that
                  introduced Santiniketan techniques of rendering three
                  dimensions without using chiaroscuro into the Slade print
                  rooms, where students and staff worked side by side in an
                  environment of convivial exchange, and left their prints to
                  dry in the common areas.

                  during a period when Britain imagined its own post-imperial

                  foundation or post-war restarting of three universities (the
                  University of Malta, the University of Hong Kong, and the
                  University of Malaya) and five university colleges (University
                  College of the West Indies; the University College of the Gold

                  Within this system, the Slade took a pastoral role in guiding
                  the establishment of art education in colonial universities,
                  particularly in Africa. Slade records show that Coldstream was
                  consulted when colonial universities were seeking new faculty,
                  and that he sometimes even played a role as an external
                  examiner. His advice was not always appreciated. In 1958, two
                  years after Nigeria achieved provisional independence from
                  Britain, Coldstream received a letter from Slade alumnus Ben
                  Enwonwu (1944–1947), who had become an art supervisor in
                  Nigeria’s Information Services Department. Taking umbrage at
                  Coldstream’s planned role in developing art institutions in
                  Nigeria, he wrote to Coldstream (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-19">Fig.&nbsp;36</a>), repudiating Slade intervention into the Nigerian art
                  school system:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    I am to make recommendations to my Government on Nigerian
                    Art and Culture generally and want to explore, in accordance
                    with your own scheme, how much [the] Western system of Art
                    Education may be helpful in achieving the cultural and
                    artistic rebirth which we are working for. If our Art does
                    not express African characteristics, then it can play no
                    significant role in our development as a Nation. I am not
                    sure that the entire influence of the Slade School would be
                    a good thing.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Enwonwu was particularly concerned due to a recent visit to
                  the Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology by
                  Professor Alfred Gerrard, who had served as an external
                  examiner at the college. It was there that the Zaria Art
                  Society was formed in 1958, and whose members advocated for a
                  “natural synthesis” of European modernist and African visual
                  vocabularies. The Zarianists, for their part, regarded Enwonwu
                  as overly influenced by primitivist aesthetics, and criticized
                  his embrace of Négritude<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57">57</a></sup>
                  as a colonial hangover.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58">58</a></sup>

                  The School of Art at Makerere College (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-19">Fig. 37</a>),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59">59</a></sup>
                  Kampala (in the former Ugandan Protectorate) was founded in
                  the 1930s by Margaret Trowell, a Slade alumna and a Christian
                  with missionary leanings and “evangelical zeal”, and was the
                  first school in East Africa to offer “professional” European
                  art training (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-20">Fig.&nbsp;38</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60">60</a></sup>
                  In 1949, the school was included among a network of colonial
                  universities that was governed by the IUCHEC. This council
                  established a “special relationship” with the University of
                  London, which it turned to for advice and support in the
                  establishment and testing of courses in colonial universities,
                  in line with British degree-granting standards.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61">61</a></sup>
                  The IUCHEC, made up of representatives from British
                  universities, also had a significant role in staff recruitment
                  for the colonial universities; encouraging secondment of staff
                  from “home” universities; and supporting scholarship schemes
                  and the development of teaching resources.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn62" id="fnref62">62</a></sup>
                  Following Trowell’s vision, the art school at Makerere was
                  modelled closely after the Slade, introducing figurative art
                  and European art history while seeking to retain the influence
                  of local traditions, conditions, and context, with the
                  apparent aim of keeping it relevant to local needs (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-21">Fig. 38</a>). Yet, as in colonial India, where Bengal School idioms were
                  defined at the intersection of Orientalism and nationalism,
                  here, at Makerere College, Trowell’s definition of regional
                  traditions was an invented one, inflected by primitivism.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn63" id="fnref63">63</a></sup>
                  Indeed, the artistic vocabularies favoured by Makerere College
                  reflected Trowell’s own biases towards figurative art in a
                  context where figuration was not part of local practices.
                  Paradoxically, as Emma Wolukau-Wanambwa has argued, Trowell
                  also rejected artworks that too closely followed modern
                  Western models, preferring primitivist figuration which was
                  also more popular on the art market.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn64" id="fnref64">64</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Between 1951 and 1958, William Coldstream, then Slade
                  Professor and Principal, supported Trowell’s plan by advising
                  on the development of the new fine art diploma and validating
                  it to relevant authorities. Indeed, Trowell wrote to
                  Coldstream on 29 June 1955, requesting assurances for both
                  Makerere’s Academic Board and the Director of Education in the
                  three East African Territories, “who would like to have it on
                  paper” that Coldstream had approved of the proposed plans for
                  the course (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-21">Fig.&nbsp;39</a>). He served as an external examiner, visiting the college in
                  1957, and implemented this arrangement with the Slade moving
                  forward, and served on appointment committees for key members
                  of Makerere College staff (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-21">Fig.&nbsp;39</a><a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-22">)</a>. The corresponding administrative file in the Slade archive
                  illustrates the colonial structures and mindsets underpinning
                  these pedagogical and artistic relationships. Yet equally,
                  reflecting his interest in fostering multiple styles and
                  approaches to making art within the Slade, Coldstream also
                  advised Trowell that the imposition of British standards onto
                  Makerere College would be counterproductive for the students,
                  writing that “it is so difficult to correlate standards of
                  what must be widely different types of work, though
                  [<em>sic</em>] I think the whole question of standards is best
                  left out of it” (see&nbsp;<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-21">Fig.&nbsp;39</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  From 1952 to 1955, after studying at Makerere College, Sam
                  Ntiro attended the Slade at the encouragement of Trowell. Once
                  at the Slade, Ntiro was a popular and charismatic student,
                  serving as the Slade representative of the Union Council
                  (1954–1955), and as treasurer of the Slade Society
                  (1954–1955). Upon graduation, Ntiro returned to teach at
                  Makerere College, and kept up a friendly epistolary
                  relationship with Coldstream, as well as with Slade Secretary
                  Ian Tregarthen Jenkin (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-23">Figs. 45</a><a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-23">–50</a>). Ntiro’s enthusiasm at Coldstream’s impending visit to
                  Makerere in 1956 is palpable in the letter from his student
                  file, which expresses how all the staff and students are
                  looking “forward to your visit as it is going to mean so much
                  to the future of our Art School”, and that “nothing would give
                  me more ‘kick’ than to see you in person here!” (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-21">Fig. 45</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ntiro’s position was, however, complex. Although he maintained
                  warm relations with Coldstream as a mentor—and from the
                  correspondence, it would suggest welcomed his involvement with
                  Makerere College—he was under no illusions about colonialism.
                  Of particular note is a letter that Ntiro wrote to Tregarthen
                  Jenkin on 16 October 1958, after he had assumed duties as
                  acting head of Makerere College, due to Trowell’s illness. In
                  it, he clearly states his hopes for self-government, and
                  responds to an inquiry from Tregarthen Jenkin about the
                  Capricorn Africa Society, writing, “You asked me about
                  Capricorn Africa Society. It is regarded by Africans in East
                  Africa as a means of pacifying Africans and keeping them from
                  attaining self-government.” He signs off the letter with a
                  critique of Tanganyika’s tripartite voting system, with
                  reserved seats in government determined by race, stating that
                  “In spite of that, Tanganyika will achieve self-government”
                  (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-23">Figs. 49 and 50</a>). Ntiro went on to fight for independence, becoming the
                  Republic of Tanganyika’s first High Commissioner to the United
                  Kingdom (1961–1964), and from 1967 to 1973 served as the
                  Commissioner of Culture for the Government of the United
                  Republic of Tanzania (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-24">Fig.&nbsp;51</a>). The records speak to the fluidity of interpersonal
                  registers between Ntiro and those at the Slade, expressing at
                  once formalities and hierarchies (“Dear Sir William
                  Coldstream”), but later marked by friendship (“My Dear Bill”,
                  and “My Dear Sam”). Notes exchanged share news of family and
                  projects (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-23">Figs.&nbsp;45–47</a>,
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-23">54–56</a>), and are equally counterbalanced with reference requests
                  (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-22">Figs.&nbsp;40–44</a>), and more formal dispatches, such as the note of
                  congratulations sent on the occasion of Ntiro’s appointment as
                  High Commissioner on 4&nbsp;April 1963 (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-24">Fig.&nbsp;53</a>). That he should appear in both an individual student file
                  and institution-to-institution ones is telling of the bridging
                  role he held at the intersection of artist, mentor/mentee,
                  pupil, postcolonial diplomat, and colleague, and the
                  multivalent power dynamics that this engendered.

                  The experience of study in Britain was not a uniformly
                  positive one for many overseas students, as they faced culture
                  shock, racism, and loss of status in their new environments.
                  Yet, they also found ways of life that provided them with more
                  than just a Slade education. While in London, these artists
                  befriended students from other countries; visited global
                  museum collections, many containing objects purloined by
                  agents of the British Empire; and they watched films from
                  other places, giving them new frameworks for their artistic
                  practices. They travelled while they were at the Slade,
                  visiting museums, monuments, and collections in Europe; even
                  en route, they had adventures, stopping to explore other
                  countries on the way. These encounters expanded their frames
                  of reference, their mastery of multiple aesthetic systems and
                  vocabularies, and made the condition of mobility central to
                  their understanding of modernity. As Edward Said argues about
                  the experience of exile, the “plurality of vision” opened up
                  by the experiences that these artists had at the Slade and in
                  London more generally, gave “rise to an awareness of
                  simultaneous dimensions”, which they seized upon in acts of
                  interpretation and creation to produce complex contrapuntal
                  structures.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn65" id="fnref65">65</a></sup>
                  These contrapuntal interventions went beyond simple
                  cosmopolitanism, as they were realized within an awareness of,
                  and negotiation with, the British Empire. More often than not,
                  they represented critical assertions of “simultaneous visions”
                  in a context where the modernity of their aesthetic
                  propositions was not fully acknowledged.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn66" id="fnref66">66</a></sup>
                  The entangled worlds that they made through their artistic
                  practices resonated with those of other overseas artists in
                  post-war and increasingly post-imperial Britain and beyond,
                  creating a cultural and artistic fabric woven from the complex
                  threads of post-Empire.

                <p>
                  Ultimately, it is by looking at these works transversally that
                  a contrapuntal fugue of post-Empire begins to emerge, exposing
                  as reductive the analytical models that art historians have
                  been using to understand the history of modern art, and
                  revealing the complex cartographies produced through “London,
                  Asia”. Here, we put this into practice looking at five
                  particular artists who studied at the Slade.

                <h3>Zainul Abedin</h3>
                <p>
                  For Zainul Abedin, time at the Slade provided not just
                  exposure to new pedagogical approaches in the life drawing
                  room and printmaking formulas in the print room, but also to
                  understand more about the logics of modernism through
                  lectures, museum visits, and the critical responses to his two
                  London exhibitions. Held at the Imperial Institute (1951) and
                  at the Berkeley Galleries (1952) while he was in London,
                  Abedin’s exhibitions drew critical praise, especially for the
                  works from his acclaimed 1943 series on the Bengal Famine.
                  Eric Newton commented that they “are brilliant drawings done
                  at white heat under the immediate spur of a visible tragedy”
                  (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-13">Fig.&nbsp;25</a>). At a time when European and American art were heading
                  towards pure abstraction, British art was, as James Hyman
                  argues, looking for alternative models of realism, and Abedin
                  provided a novel and powerful model.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn67" id="fnref67">67</a></sup>
                  In his London sketchbook (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-25">Fig. 57</a>), Abedin demonstrates his virtuosity and experimentation
                  with multiple visual vocabularies, from academic realism, to
                  reduced, post-cubist experiments*,* as well as an expressive
                  language of ink adapted from the Bengal School, itself a
                  synthetic form created at the Calcutta Government School of
                  Art in relation to East Asian ink painting (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-26">Fig.&nbsp;58</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn68" id="fnref68">68</a></sup>
                  Analytical in his approach, his dissection of cubist space in
                  certain sketches (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-27">Fig. 59</a>) provides rare insight into the series of paintings that he
                  made at the Slade and shortly after, such as
                  <em>Woman with a Pitcher</em> (1951) (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-28">Fig.&nbsp;60</a>).
                </p>
                <h3>Tseng Yu</h3>
                <p>
                  For Tseng Yu, the question of representation was a
                  contrapuntal symphony, in which artists invoking multiple
                  historic traditions took up themes such as resemblance,
                  expression, perspective, line, space, and colour in
                  complementary fugues. As a student, Tseng was highly regarded
                  and, in 1954–1955, shared the prize for Head Painting with
                  Paula Rego.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn69" id="fnref69">69</a></sup>
                  Like Abedin, Tseng was committed to defining his own approach
                  to realism, and wrote to Coldstream after he had moved to
                  Paris to study at the École des Beaux Arts in Paris that he
                  found Tachisme suffocating, writing in 1957 that “the pressure
                  to conformity in Paris is so oppressive that [it] often makes
                  me so totalitarian in a fatal attempt to defend my
                  belief”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn70" id="fnref70">70</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A lecture that Tseng gave at the Slade in 1975 demonstrates
                  the analytical ways in which he was thinking comparatively
                  about Chinese and European aesthetic systems, dissecting
                  different modes of defining line, space, form, time, and
                  “spiritual resonance” in the two visual languages (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-51">Fig. 99</a>). <em>Interior with a Man Painting</em> (1955), made while a
                  student at the Slade, engages cleverly with the artificiality
                  of representation, multiple vocabularies of abstraction, and
                  questions of race and identity (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-28">Fig.&nbsp;61</a>). In this work, which depicts a faceless and ambiguously
                  racialized man with blue hair painting a still life of two
                  fruits on a table, Tseng experiments with the use of negative
                  space in order to define three-dimensional form. Where
                  normally there would be a line defining shadows and volume on
                  the tablecloth, and at the corners where the walls meet the
                  ceiling, here Tseng uses empty space, what he calls “infinite
                  space” in the lecture, which he describes as “gradually
                  invading the solid quality of an object”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn71" id="fnref71">71</a></sup>
                  His depiction of fruit on a table with its surface tipped
                  towards the picture plane makes reference to Paul Cézanne,
                  whose work he identifies in the lecture with a disintegration
                  of form similar to that found in twelfth-century Chinese
                  painting. At once defining his own contrapuntal vocabulary of
                  form and making a claim to Cézanne’s modernist innovations,
                  Tseng resists the Orientalist expectation to perform
                  difference, yet thematizes mobility and contrapuntal
                  aesthetics in his modes of representation.

                  In a letter to the noted Sinologist and translator David
                  Hawkes, from the collection of the Chinese University of Hong
                  Kong Library, Tseng described the ambivalent subjectivities
                  engendered by Britain’s colonial enterprise, both in the UK
                  and overseas (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-29">Fig.&nbsp;62</a>). He wrote:

                <h3>Wendy Yeo</h3>
                <p>
                  Wendy Yeo first attended the Slade for a brief period in 1953
                  as a short-term “external” student, when she accompanied her
                  family to the UK at the age of sixteen, then still in
                  secondary school. Hailing from a prominent medical family in
                  British colonial Hong Kong with deep roots in the UK, being
                  educated in Britain was a well-established pathway, although
                  the pursuit of fine art was not. Later, Yeo returned to attend
                  as a full-time student (1955–1959), after Slade alumna
                  Madeleine Pearson (1927–1928) admired her work at an
                  exhibition in Hong Kong and persuaded her reluctant parents to
                  allow her to pursue her art practice at the Slade.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yeo had been trained in both Chinese and Western painting
                  before leaving Hong Kong, and won many awards at the Slade,
                  later obtaining a place as a postgraduate student. Yeo’s
                  paintings at the Slade engaged playfully and cross-culturally
                  with her lessons on mathematical perspective, bringing an
                  understanding of aerial or axonometric perspective from her
                  studies in Chinese painting, to her Euston Road inflected
                  representations of present-ness. In both
                  <em>Townscape with Figures</em> (1958) (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-29">Fig.&nbsp;63</a>) and <em>Mountain Streams</em> (1958–1959) (reproduced in
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-30">Fig.&nbsp;64</a>), Yeo uses aerial perspective to draw the viewer into her
                  landscapes, encouraging an embodied and sustained interaction
                  with the works that refuses the optical mastery of one-point
                  perspective. She explored avenues that enabled her to
                  articulate the “plurality of her vision” and journeyed through
                  Europe on a scholarship in her final year at the Slade.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn72" id="fnref72">72</a></sup>
                  At the recommendation of her tutor Anthony Gross, she spent
                  time at Stanley William Hayter’s Atelier 17 in Paris, where
                  she assisted Hayter and Krishna Reddy (Slade 1951–1952), among
                  others, to develop colour etching, and connected with other
                  international artists, before returning to Hong Kong for two
                  years, prior to settling in the UK (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-30">Fig.&nbsp;64</a>). These experiences informed her experimentations in
                  technique at the intersections of abstraction and ink
                  painting, and through combining materials such as oil and
                  paint, paper, raw linen, and wax.

                  Anwar Jalal Shemza’s oft-repeated and devastating realization
                  in Ernst Gombrich’s class that Islamic art was not understood
                  as art because it was functional opened his eyes to the limits
                  of European universalism. In the artist’s statement
                  accompanying an exhibition of his paintings and drawings at
                  the Gulbenkian Museum of Oriental Art, Durham in 1963 (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-31">Fig.&nbsp;65</a>), he wrote:

                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    One evening, when I was attending a Slade weekly lecture on
                    the history of art, Prof. Gombrich came to the chapter on
                    Islamic Art—an art which was “functional”—from his book,
                    “The Story of Art”.<br>
                    All evening I destroyed paintings, drawings, everything that
                    could be called “art”. All night I argued with somebody—as I
                    was told next morning by my hostel neighbour. All day
                    restlessness sent me from place to place, until I found
                    myself in the Egyptian section at the British Museum. For
                    the first time in England, I felt really at home.

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  For Shemza, the realization came all at once, that Islamic Art
                  did not partake of “universal” European epistemologies and
                  could not be called “art” within that system because it was
                  functional. Having been educated at the Mayo School of Arts
                  when it was still focused on art industry, before its
                  transformation into an art school in the form of the National
                  College of Arts, Lahore, Shemza received a commercial art
                  diploma before going to the Slade to study. As a member of the
                  Lahore Art Circle and a successful artist in Pakistan, it was
                  not until that moment in Gombrich’s class that the hierarchies
                  of the colonial art system condensed into form for Shemza.
                  That moment of alienation allowed Shemza to see the operations
                  of art history, and enabled a decolonial critique, as well as
                  the possibility of solidarity. Indeed, it is crucial to note
                  that Shemza’s response was not that of an essentialist
                  assertion of national identity. He did not, for example, find
                  himself at home in the South Asian collections of the British
                  Museum, but rather in the Egyptian wing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the work <em>The Wall</em> (1958) created shortly after
                  this crisis, Shemza created a painting that was at once
                  abstract, representational, and decorative, piercing to the
                  heart of the problem posed by Gombrich’s analysis of Islamic
                  art as functional (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-32">Fig.&nbsp;66</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn73" id="fnref73">73</a></sup>
                  The work appears at first entirely abstract, placing a figure
                  defined by graphic lines against a two-toned ground of thick,
                  impasted paint in a manner that nods towards Paul Klee, an
                  important reference point for Shemza. The title,
                  <em>The Wall</em>, pulls the work back to a realm of
                  representation, however, causing a shift in the viewer’s
                  perception of form, as the figure resolves into what in some
                  of his other works of the same period is explicitly identified
                  as a city wall, ornamented with Islamic patterns that, in this
                  context, call into question the distinction made in Western
                  modernism between abstraction and Islamic decoration. It is as
                  if in this work, Shemza is taking Gombrich’s thinking about
                  the openness of art’s epistemologies to its logical
                  conclusion, and using it to challenge his claims about Islamic
                  art. By positing abstraction, realism, and decoration as three
                  possible contradictory readings within the same work, Shemza
                  questions their separability, positing the inextricability of
                  modernism and its presumed others.

                    when I went to the Slade there was art history where you

                    kind of epitome of Western art, which is the Renaissance,
                    and I still don’t feel that way … there were other things
                    equally good … so in the end, you just have to go according

                  stopping along the way to pursue what she called her “real
                  visual education” (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-32">Fig.&nbsp;67</a>). Study trips to Japan, India, Cambodia, and Egypt, among
                  other stops, endowed Lim with a sense of space, vocabularies
                  of ornament, and an understanding of the capacities of
                  abstraction far beyond the Eurocentric models that she learned
                  at the Slade.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn76" id="fnref76">76</a></sup>

                  experiment with salvaged stones, and an engagement with the
                  surfaces of ruins that she saw in her far-ranging travels.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn77" id="fnref77">77</a></sup>

                  This section conducts a transversal comparison of three groups
                  of pedagogical artefacts from three different sites—Dhaka,
                  Lahore, and the Sinophone world—in order to analyse the ways
                  in which artists who passed through the Slade appropriated and
                  transformed pedagogical and artistic models that they
                  encountered there.

                  Given that these artists began their studies in other
                  contexts, and that some of them were already teaching at or
                  leading art institutions when they went to study abroad, the
                  Slade School of Fine Art functioned as a contrapuntal node
                  that contributed to, but did not fully determine, the
                  formation of the artists who attended it. Here, the notion of
                  journeying <em>through</em> modernism rather than <em>to</em>,
                  as articulated by Lotte Hoek and Sanjukta Sunderason, is an
                  important idea as it captures the significance of London as a
                  site of critical engagement rather than as a pilgrimage
                  destination.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn78" id="fnref78">78</a></sup>
                  Importantly, it also operated as a multivocal contact zone
                  where, as Wendy Yeo related in an oral history interview,
                  Slade students often learned as much from each other as from
                  their tutors.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn79" id="fnref79">79</a></sup>

                  Until William Coldstream was appointed Slade principal in
                  1949, the Slade curriculum was based on a Beaux Arts model,
                  which followed a strict progression from drawing from antique
                  plaster casts to drawing in the life room, before painting and
                  sculpture could be taken at more senior levels. This
                  methodology stressed the pre-eminence—both visual and
                  ideological—of classical European models, and left little room
                  for other modes of representation. This was, for example, the
                  curriculum that Ben Enwonwu (1944–1947) and Shakir Ali
                  (1946–1949) encountered during their times at the Slade.
                  Enwonwu’s response, explored already in the section “Imagining
                  Postcolonial States”, was one of rejection, whereas Shakir
                  Ali’s engagement with the Beaux Arts model (filtered through
                  his time in Paris and Prague), led him to adapt and
                  incorporate modernist approaches. Appointed the first
                  Pakistani principal of the National College of Arts in 1961,
                  Ali implemented curricular reform that entailed refusing the
                  colonial curriculum of the Mayo School of Arts. For him, this
                  required a greater focus on the fine arts, and a rejection of
                  the craft orientation of both the Mayo School’s programme of
                  industrial art and design and the Bauhaus-inspired reforms
                  which had been implemented to integrate art and craft under
                  the NCA’s first principal, Mark Ritter Sponenburgh, with the
                  collaboration of Jamila Zaidi.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn80" id="fnref80">80</a></sup>
                  As Nadeem Omar Tarar argues, Ali’s postcolonial modernism
                  followed theories of modernisation and development, steering
                  the NCA curriculum away from craft. Still, Ali moved beyond
                  his Slade training, towards modernist epistemologies, drawing
                  on his time at André Lhote’s studio in 1948, and in leftist
                  circles in Prague between 1947 and 1951.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn81" id="fnref81">81</a></sup>
                  This represented Ali’s own assessment of what constituted
                  modernity after independence. As Iftikhar Dadi writes, Ali
                  “modernized postcolonial subjectivity in Pakistan by
                  persistently disregarding formulaic responses”, imagining the
                  possibility of a postcolonial subject that was not purely
                  local.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn82" id="fnref82">82</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Coldstream’s arrival at the Slade in 1949 brought many
                  changes. He reoriented the school’s focus away from a Beaux
                  Arts model towards methods of inquiry. As a result, in
                  lectures on art history and in the studio, idealized
                  aesthetics became less central. Coldstream was a painter of
                  the Euston Road School, which sought to create works
                  accessible to a larger public through observational realism
                  and engagement with social issues. For Coldstream, the goal
                  was not to continue in the academic tradition of the Beaux
                  Arts, nor to transmit Euston Road School painting as a
                  technique or follow current trends, but rather to create an
                  environment where representation and form were aligned with
                  research and society rather than style. Not long after the end
                  of the Second World War, when the British art world was in a
                  state of aesthetic flux, these reforms contributed to a
                  pedagogical environment where the relationship between art
                  practice and the history of European art was purposefully
                  misaligned, pivoting students gently away from the history of
                  Continental European art as the model for all art-making.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn83" id="fnref83">83</a></sup>
                  As Courtney Martin argues of Coldstream’s impact on Shemza,
                  “The Euston Road example would also have showed Shemza that
                  there was more than one way to be modern”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn84" id="fnref84">84</a></sup>

                <p>
                  The 1950–1951 UCL Course Calendar (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-37">Fig.&nbsp;75</a>) details some of Coldstream’s reforms, including a pivot
                  away from drawing from the antique towards observational
                  practice as well as a less technical and more intellectual
                  approach to anatomy and perspective (see&nbsp;also&nbsp;<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-46">Fig.&nbsp;93</a>). Additionally, this revised curriculum placed a greater
                  emphasis on the study of art history and complementary
                  subjects in addition to studio practice, encouraging a variety
                  of different artistic styles. As Coldstream commented in 1965,
                  “A modern art school is run on the understanding that all
                  sorts of ideas and approaches, good of their kind, have to be
                  encouraged”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn85" id="fnref85">85</a></sup>
                  Unlike the Bauhaus curriculum—then a major pedagogical model
                  that was gaining currency during this period in the UK, South
                  Asia, and beyond—the Slade did not embrace the inclusion of
                  craft into the curriculum, and continued a Beaux Arts focus on
                  realism, albeit with a major epistemological shift away from
                  idealized form. Critically, whereas Bauhaus pedagogy only
                  provided instruction in art history in so far as it informed
                  the teaching of historical artistic techniques, art history
                  has been taught consistently at the Slade since 1904, and was
                  made into a central, foundational subject under
                  Coldstream.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn86" id="fnref86">86</a></sup>
                  In the 1960 report of the National Advisory Council on Art
                  Education headed by Coldstream, he advocates for the
                  centrality of art history in British art schools, stating that
                  “The presence of art historians … [has] enabl[ed] the student
                  to understand relationships between his own activities and the
                  culture within which he lives.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn87" id="fnref87">87</a></sup>
                  Within this pedagogical framework, students were not taught to
                  revere an idealized past (although Eurocentric hierarchies and
                  epistemologies were omnipresent, as discussed in the “Schema
                  and Correction: Repositioning Art Histories” section), but to
                  understand how to critically situate their work within the
                  history of European art.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this section, we examine three case studies that
                  demonstrate some of the interconnected ways in which artists
                  critically engaged with the Slade curriculum. In particular,
                  this section surfaces how artists judiciously supplemented or
                  disrupted instruction in European art and art history in
                  various ways, provincializing Eurocentrism in the process. We
                  consider curricular developments at the Government Institute
                  of Arts in Dhaka following Zainul Abedin’s return from the
                  Slade; curricular developments implemented at the National
                  College of Arts, Lahore by Jamila Zaidi under Principal Mark
                  Ritter Sponenburgh; as well as two art history textbooks
                  translated by Tseng Yu.
                </p>
                <h3>
                  Zainul Abedin and the Government Institute of Arts, Dhaka
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Already the principal of the Government Institute of Arts,
                  Dhaka (GIA) and an accomplished cultural bureaucrat by the
                  time he arrived at the Slade in 1951, Zainul Abedin went to
                  the UK with a mission to gather information about artistic and
                  pedagogical methods towards the development of cultural policy
                  and art education in Pakistan.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn88" id="fnref88">88</a></sup>
                  Indeed, it is possible to see how Abedin approached his
                  encounter with Slade analytically, assessing and translating
                  methodologies on the spot to determine how they might or might
                  not be applicable in Pakistan. In his meticulous notes on
                  printmaking, for example, Zainul Abedin identified methods of
                  mixing printmaking ink from lampblack, polishing burnishers
                  with knife polish, creating plate cleaning solvents with
                  household ingredients, and identifying alternative resists for
                  aquatint, seeking methods and materials that were practicable
                  in Pakistan (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-38">Fig. 76</a>). These notes capture the granularity of concerns that he
                  expressed in letters home to his colleague Anwarul Huq, which
                  reflect on how his experiences in London could be useful to
                  the GIA.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn89" id="fnref89">89</a></sup>
                  More materially, Abedin also had two etching machines and a
                  library of art books sent to Dhaka, establishing a fine arts
                  library, which he stipulated was important for “develop[ing]
                  knowledge of history of arts”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn90" id="fnref90">90</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the GIA was established in 1948, it followed the
                  curriculum of the Calcutta School of Art, where all of the
                  founders of the GIA were teaching or studying before
                  Partition. A two-year Elementary Course was followed by three
                  years of specialization in Fine Art (Drawing and Painting), or
                  Commercial Art (Graphic Design), and no theoretical subjects
                  were offered.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn91" id="fnref91">91</a></sup>
                  The first-year course focused mainly on drawing, and the
                  distinctions between fine art and commercial art reflected
                  European categorizations of the arts that formed the basis of
                  the British curriculum on which the Calcutta School of Art was
                  founded. Abedin’s year at the Slade (1951–1952) appears to
                  have been a turning point, since upon his return, he proposed
                  a new curriculum and, in 1955, the Department of Oriental Art
                  was established (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-39">Fig. 77</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn92" id="fnref92">92</a></sup>
                  The syllabus takes some elements from the Slade undergraduate
                  curriculum, yet introduces a contrapuntal perspective, lightly
                  situating the curriculum within an art-historical framework,
                  which Abedin intended to support with the creation of an art
                  library. The syllabus maintains the GIA’s previous emphasis on
                  drawing as the foundation of all instruction, systematically
                  introduces perspective and anatomy into the Elementary Course,
                  and introduces instruction in the history of art. In addition,
                  the new syllabus creates the Department of Oriental Art, and
                  puts “Western” and “Oriental” art in dialogue, requiring all
                  students to take both in the Elementary Course. Specialization
                  would become possible in the third year, and a programme
                  adapted from Bengal School methodologies provided instruction
                  in Oriental drapery, fresco, and architecture, as well as
                  theoretical instruction in the “methods of old masters, and
                  history of Oriental painting”. As Lala Rukh Selim observes,
                  this programme was localized further by introducing outdoor
                  sketching of landscape and figures, in the syllabus rendered
                  as “outdoor study, flowers and foliage, and drawing from
                  life”. Focusing largely on the Bengali countryside, labourers,
                  and artisans, this provided a leftist take on
                  <em>plein air</em> training.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn93" id="fnref93">93</a></sup>

                <p>
                  The Mayo School of Arts in Lahore was established in 1875 as
                  one of four art institutions located in the major metropolises
                  of colonial India. Under the leadership of its first
                  principal, John Lockwood Kipling, the Mayo School became a
                  pre-eminent centre for the development of craft and art
                  industry (along with the Industrial School of Arts in Madras,
                  established in 1854), offering courses such as woodworking and
                  metalworking. Tellingly, it operated under the Department of
                  Industries until it became the National College of Arts,
                  Lahore, in 1958. As such, its original mandate was very
                  different from that of art schools such as the Calcutta School
                  of Art (established in 1854) and the Sir Jamsetji Jeejibhoy
                  School of Art, Bombay (established in 1857). The transition
                  from the Mayo School of Arts to the National College of Arts
                  (NCA) was stewarded by Principal Mark Ritter Sponenburgh
                  (1957–1961), an American artist who had trained at the Arts
                  and Crafts inspired Cranbrook Academy of Art, the École des
                  Beaux Arts in Paris, and the American Research Centre in
                  Cairo, and spent a year teaching at the Royal Academy of Art
                  in London, prior to being hired as the NCA’s first principal.
                  Sponenburgh’s vision for the NCA was, as Iram Zia Raja notes,
                  “based loosely on the model of Bauhaus, yet rooted in the
                  indigenous mores of arts and crafts”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn94" id="fnref94">94</a></sup>
                  Indeed, Sponenburgh took a major interest in the folk arts of
                  the Swat valley, and organized the first national exhibition
                  on that subject during his tenure as principal.

                <p>
                  Drawing on resources made available through the Colombo Plan,
                  Sponenburgh hired many foreign faculty members as well as
                  artists who had been trained abroad. In 1960, he hired Jamila
                  Zaidi, the first Pakistani woman to graduate from the Slade.
                  Although Zaidi has not received as much attention as other NCA
                  founding faculty, and although she was at the NCA for a short
                  time, from 1960 to 1964, the archives demonstrate the
                  important role that she assumed as the NCA representative on
                  national curriculum committees, as a national curriculum
                  textbook author (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-14">Figs.&nbsp;27–31</a>), and as a thinker about art pedagogy (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-40">Figs. 78 and 79</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Studying at the Slade from 1954 to 1957, Zaidi overlapped with
                  Khalid Iqbal, Kim Lim, Sam Ntiro, Gazbia Sirry, K.G.
                  Subramanyan, Ibrahim El-Salahi, Anwar Jalal Shemza, Tseng Yu,
                  and Wendy Yeo, who are all mentioned in this feature, as well
                  as other overseas students. This particularly interesting
                  moment of transversal crossings would have provided Zaidi with
                  a comparative ecology against which to imagine other
                  postcolonial pedagogies. When she was hired in 1960 by
                  Sponenburgh, her thinking about art and education condensed
                  into a vision that brought together her fine art training with
                  Sponenburgh’s interest in craft, challenging epistemological
                  divisions between the two. Indeed, she proudly advocated for
                  contrapuntal pedagogies that wove together art and craft: on
                  her CV, Zaidi mentioned that she had made “art and craft”
                  compulsory in secondary education, that she had written a
                  textbook titled <em>Story of Art</em>, and had co-taught a
                  course on “Folk Arts and Crafts in Pakistan” at the NCA (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-40">Fig. 78</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn95" id="fnref95">95</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The 1960–1961 curriculum for the foundation course “Intro to
                  the Visual Arts” separates “related arts” from “applied and
                  industrial design”, placing Zaidi’s Folk Arts and Crafts
                  course in the latter category, with Architecture and
                  Archaeology in Pakistan in the “related arts” term (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-41">Fig.&nbsp;80</a>). A syllabus for the History of Art and Architecture from
                  the same set of documents provides further context,
                  demonstrating a comparative and global approach to teaching
                  art history, in the Fall term covering East Asia, South Asia,
                  Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Greek, Roman, and Buddhist art, with
                  only minimal attention paid to European prehistoric art (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-41">Figs.&nbsp;81 and 82</a>). History of Art II offers a history of Architecture,
                  Sculpture and Painting in France 1848–1960, along with
                  sections on “Luministic Realism” in Tokugawa Japan and
                  “Impressionism” in Islamic Art, in an effort to place French
                  modernism within a global context (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-41">Figs.&nbsp;83 and 84</a>). These efforts to disrupt the Eurocentrism of art history
                  also translated into the practice side of the curriculum,
                  which we can see in a contemporaneous note setting out the
                  syllabus for a third-year class on technical methods, which
                  focuses on copying from miniature paintings, and introduces
                  techniques such as brush and ink, wash, colour, and
                  application of gold leaf (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-41">Fig.&nbsp;85</a>). Furthermore, when Zaidi presented the paper “Criticism in
                  Art Education at the College Level” at the 16th All-Pakistan
                  Science Conference as a delegate from the NCA in 1963, she
                  addressed the importance of using critique as a pedagogical
                  tool to help students navigate between multiple artistic
                  systems (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-40">Fig. 79</a>). Although when Shakir Ali became principal in 1961, he
                  shifted the curriculum towards European art and its methods,
                  it is useful to trace this brief moment of contrapuntal
                  pedagogy developed by Sponenburgh with Zaidi’s
                  contribution.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn96" id="fnref96">96</a></sup>
                  They laid the groundwork for later developments in the Print
                  department that will be discussed in Part 2 of this “Slade,
                  London, Asia” feature, which will focus on the 1960s to the
                  1990s.

                <h3>Tseng Yu and Art Education in Hong Kong and Taiwan</h3>
                <p>
                  As a young student at the Slade, Tseng Yu developed strong
                  relationships with both William Coldstream and William
                  Townsend, evident in the archive through the warmth of their
                  correspondence and, in the case of Townsend, a friendship that
                  evolved to include visits to his home in Kent and the exchange
                  of works of art. Tseng’s letters to Coldstream show him
                  seeking to educate the Slade professor about contemporary
                  Chinese art (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-50">Figs.&nbsp;97 and 98</a>), and he later returned to the Slade in 1975 to give a
                  lecture about Chinese painting to Slade students (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-51">Fig. 99</a>). Tseng saw himself as a contrapuntal mediator, bringing
                  knowledge about Chinese art history and aesthetics to European
                  audiences, and vice versa. Tseng was born in Shanghai, but had
                  moved to Hong Kong by the time he applied to the Slade in
                  1952. After graduating from the Slade in 1956, he moved to
                  Paris and studied at the École des Beaux Arts, spending some
                  time at Stanley William Hayter’s Atelier 17 (another node for
                  former Slade graduates), then moved to Rome in 1960, where he
                  stayed for ten years before being hired as Department Head of
                  Fine Arts at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in
                  1971.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Department of Fine Arts at CUHK was founded in 1957 as a
                  two-year Fine Arts Specialized Training Program at New Asia
                  College, and was the first tertiary institution in Hong Kong
                  to offer courses in Studio Practice and Art History. Founded
                  by Principal Ch’ien Mu and other scholars from mainland China
                  in Hong Kong, the New Asia College was an effort to establish
                  Chinese language, culture, and learning at the level of
                  tertiary education within an ecosystem of British colonial
                  education.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn97" id="fnref97">97</a></sup>
                  The Fine Arts programme was established by École des Beaux
                  Arts-trained Chen Shi-wen and Tokyo School of Fine
                  Arts-trained Ding Yanyong, and today “carries a special
                  mission to promote the study of Chinese art and culture and
                  the exchange of Chinese and Western art with dual emphasis on
                  studio practice and art theories”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn98" id="fnref98">98</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tseng was hired at a critical moment for the Department of
                  Fine Arts and stewarded an important transition as department
                  head. It was under Tseng that the department was separated
                  from the Board of Studies in Philosophy and Fine Arts and
                  established as its own independent Board of Studies.
                  Furthermore, the 1971 CUHK <em>Bulletin</em> notes that (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-42">Figs.&nbsp;86 and 87</a>):
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    with these new appointments, it is possible to modify the
                    curriculum so that it has greater emphasis on Chinese Art
                    History. It is hoped that with the development of the
                    programme, students of Fine Arts will have an opportunity to
                    choose areas of concentration, initially between art history
                    and theory as one area and practice of art (drawing,
                    painting, sculpture, design, etc.) as another. It is also
                    hoped that eventually the following four areas of
                    concentration can be developed: Chinese Art History; Chinese
                    painting; calligraphy and seal carving; Western painting,
                    sculpture and prints; and design and ceramics.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Tseng’s pedagogical thinking was systemic and synthetic, and
                  can be analysed through three art history textbooks he
                  co-translated into Chinese: Michael Sullivan’s
                  <em>The Arts of China</em> (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-42">Fig.&nbsp;88</a>&nbsp;in 1985, H.W. Janson’s <em>History of Art</em> in 1991 (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-42">Fig. 89</a>), and Giulio Carlo Argan and Maurizio Fagiolo’s
                  <em>Guida a la storia dell’arte</em> in 1992 (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-42">Fig.&nbsp;90</a>). The combination of the three texts indicates Tseng’s
                  belief in the importance of enabling contemporary artists to
                  situate themselves within multiple histories of art. Argan and
                  Fagiolo’s <em>Guida a la storia dell’arte</em>, a book on art
                  history methodology, is of particular interest, as it is
                  accompanied by a preface written by Tseng. Reflecting the
                  department’s institutional separation from the Board of
                  Studies of Philosophy, Tseng argues for a theoretical shift in
                  Chinese art history, which he sees as too invested in
                  aesthetics and poetry rather than history, society, and
                  politics. As with Abedin, who identified the importance of
                  establishing an art library for the purposes of teaching art
                  history, Tseng identifies the creation of art libraries and
                  photographic image libraries such as the one at the Courtauld
                  Institute of Art for art students, for whom it was necessary
                  to develop a contrapuntal language of art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn99" id="fnref99">99</a></sup>

                  Schema and Correction: Repositioning Art Histories
                </h1>
                <p>
                  Between 1949 and 1961, Art History at the Slade was taught by
                  two eminent art historians, Rudolf Wittkower (1949–1956) and
                  Ernst Gombrich (1956–1961). Both European émigré scholars were
                  based at the Warburg Institute, and both were, in different
                  ways, concerned with the history of the classical tradition.
                  These two figures set the tone at the Slade by embracing new
                  art-historical methods that emphasized the relationships
                  between art and its social and historical contexts, leading to
                  a cultural relativism that, although limited by its reliance
                  upon Western epistemologies, was uncommon for its time.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn100" id="fnref100">100</a></sup>
                  This left open the possibility of what Gombrich termed “schema
                  and correction”, or challenges to the status quo.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn101" id="fnref101">101</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Both Wittkower’s and Gombrich’s inaugural lectures at UCL
                  (“The Artist and the Liberal Arts” in 1950; and “Art and
                  Scholarship” in 1957, respectively) not only elucidate the
                  historical and contemporary imperatives to ensure links
                  between arts, humanities, and sciences, but they also used
                  this platform as an opportunity to rationalize their “unusual
                  situation” (to use Wittkower’s phrase) of being art historians
                  lecturing to practising artists (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-44">Fig.&nbsp;91</a>). For his part, Gombrich advocates that scholars “turn to
                  the working artist to learn what actually happens when
                  somebody makes an image: What use does he make of tradition,
                  what difficulties does he encounter?”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn102" id="fnref102">102</a></sup>
                  This commonality between the two presentations foregrounds the
                  art school as a site of encounter not only between artists of
                  the past and those of the present, between historical and
                  modern art, but pivotally, between contemporary artists and
                  art historians. In this context, artists are understood by
                  these scholars—conceptually at least—as having agency and
                  expertise (whether or not this was acknowledged at the level
                  of individual students). Artists make use of inherited
                  “schemata”, comparing it to direct observation of their
                  surroundings, and then set about correcting the schema. For
                  artists familiar with more than one system of inherited
                  schemata, understanding them as visual languages opened up the
                  possibility of negotiating between multiple modes of
                  representation. Even so, both Gombrich and Wittkower
                  ultimately could not escape their own inherited schemata and
                  privileged pictorial realism, expressing ambivalence with
                  respect to modern art as well as to other artistic traditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Art history at the Slade also existed within a wider
                  interdisciplinary context of the university, set alongside
                  lectures on anatomy (for instance, “Growth and Form” by N.A.
                  Barnicot and biologist J.Z. Young), the psychology of vision
                  (A.R. Jonckheere), mathematical perspective (taught by B.A.R.
                  Carter, who concurrently published with Wittkower on the
                  topic),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn103" id="fnref103">103</a></sup>
                  and later film (Thorold Dickinson).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn104" id="fnref104">104</a></sup>
                  Gombrich’s lectures at the time were informed by the long
                  gestation of ideas that would come to constitute
                  <em>Art and Illusion</em> (1960). In addition to being exposed
                  to art and art histories as active and interdisciplinary
                  academic subjects, students were invited to take subsidiary
                  subjects from across the college, and attend lectures at the
                  Courtauld Institute of Art and the Bartlett School of
                  Architecture. The curriculum included a range of additional
                  visiting lecturers in art history. As indicated by the
                  1953–1954 report to the Slade Committee alone, there were
                  invited lectures by Ronald Alley, Michael Kitson, Gillo
                  Dorfles, Oliver Miller, Charles Mitchell, Ellis Waterhouse,
                  Margaret Whinney, Frances Yates, and Kenneth Clark, who, along
                  with Anthony Blunt, also served on the college’s Slade
                  Committee (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-45">Fig.&nbsp;92</a>). Yet, even with this array, the focus of study remained
                  squarely focused on classical, European, British, and American
                  art, underpinned by the presuppositions of Western ways of
                  seeing. This included the centrality of geometrical,
                  single-point perspective as a hallmark skill students were
                  accountable for, as shown by lecture notes for B.A.R. Carter’s
                  lectures on mathematical perspective and accompanying exam
                  questions (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-46">Fig.&nbsp;93</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn105" id="fnref105">105</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was in this context of intellectual openness and deeply
                  rooted Eurocentrism that overseas students critically engaged
                  with—and often rejected—the false universalism of
                  art-historical narratives taught at the Slade. Frustrated by
                  the Eurocentrism of the Slade curriculum, for example, Ben
                  Enwonwu supplemented his Slade degree with a postgraduate year
                  studying West African ethnography at University College
                  London.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn106" id="fnref106">106</a></sup>
                  As discussed in the section “Contrapuntal World-Making”, for
                  Anwar Jalal Shemza, the experience of hearing Gombrich
                  characterize Islamic art as “functional” shattered him, and
                  led him to destroy his previous works, paving the way for a
                  pictorial language of decolonial modernism that questioned the
                  distinction in European art between abstraction and decoration
                  (see
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-31">Fig.&nbsp;65</a>). Handouts from Gombrich’s lecture in the Slade archive
                  outline the art-historical paradigm Shemza would have
                  encountered in his first year at the Slade (1956–1957) (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-47">Figs.&nbsp;94</a>&nbsp;and
                  <a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-48">95</a>). Accompanying these documents are Gombrich’s own notes for
                  lecture delivery, with annotations corresponding to slides
                  that would have been screened as juxtaposed images for
                  comparing and contrasting (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-49">Fig.&nbsp;96</a>). Although hard to make out, reading them for their form and
                  structure encourages us to grasp these occasions as staged,
                  live events, and moments of intellectual and visual encounter.
                  These were performances generating an alchemy between delivery
                  and reception that could support ambivalences, nuance, and
                  critical engagement, even as they marginalized non-European
                  artistic epistemologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The documents also show how students were encouraged to view
                  artworks for themselves by visiting collections such as the
                  British Museum, in a sense extending the pedagogical space.
                  Yet, while these museums may have showcased global
                  collections, and so in principle provided pathways to enrich
                  and diversify the set curriculum, many of these artworks were
                  displaced and decontextualized, acquired through imperial and
                  colonial exploitation and violence. Moreover, through the
                  museum’s discursive enterprises, these collections were
                  deployed in ways that naturalized the dominant cultural
                  narratives of progress and cultural superiority which sought
                  to affirm Britain’s global position.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn107" id="fnref107">107</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even as a young student, Tseng Yu understood the limitations
                  of his professors’ knowledge bases—their schema—and sought to
                  educate them in Chinese art and art history. In a letter to
                  Coldstream in 1955, written when Tseng was in his third year
                  of studies, Tseng introduced the Slade professor to the work
                  of Ch’i Pai-Shih (Qi Baishi) and Hsü Pei Hung (Xu Beihong),
                  two of the most celebrated modern Chinese artists of their
                  generation (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-50">Figs.&nbsp;97 and 98</a>). Seeking to give Coldstream a lesson in contrapuntal
                  modernism, Tseng explained how “by mingling the arts and craft
                  elements and traditional elements together [Ch’i Pai Shih]
                  created a very individual style”. Not content to leave the
                  analysis at the level of particularized modernism, however,
                  Tseng also cites Renoir as having engaged in a similar
                  gesture, having “start[ed] as a porcelain painter, he started
                  from the city’s low arts and craft”. He then predicts and
                  corrects Coldstream’s response to Ch’i’s modernity, which the
                  senior painter would likely have perceived as derivative of
                  European art, writing that: “Matisse must have seen his
                  pictures, as their artistic approach is very alike. They are
                  very modern in Europe.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn108" id="fnref108">108</a></sup>
                  Turning to Hsü Pei Hong, Tseng makes an even more radical
                  correction, writing that Hsü’s “combination of East and West,
                  like Whistler’s, is a very superficial one”, knowing that Hsü
                  was likely known to Coldstream as the teacher of two former
                  Slade students, Chang Chien-Ying (1949–1951) and Fei Chengwu
                  (1950–1951).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1975, Tseng returned to the Slade, this time as a visiting
                  lecturer, and delivered a lecture comparing Chinese and
                  Western painting and aesthetics, focusing on the question of
                  “how people look” at art (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-51">Fig. 99</a>). In other words, by analysing ways of viewing, Tseng was
                  addressing Gombrich’s ideas about how schemas shape
                  perception, and making his own corrections to both Gombrich’s
                  schema and to the Slade curriculum. In this lecture, Tseng
                  addresses five points: line, intuition and measurement,
                  disintegration of form, time and space, and spiritual
                  resonance. Ultimately, Tseng argues that Chinese painting
                  offers a “new way of looking”, and a competing schema that
                  provincializes and relativizes European ways of viewing,
                  knowing, and painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Similarly, for students of Gombrich who arrived with a
                  developed postcolonial perspective, such as K.G. Subramanyan
                  and Partha Mitter (the latter his student not at the Slade but
                  University of London), Gombrich’s theoretical frameworks
                  proved useful rather than limiting, and have, in recent years,
                  been appropriated and transformed in different contexts of
                  global art and art history.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn109" id="fnref109">109</a></sup>
                  As Mitter commented about Gombrich’s former students, “We are
                  not clones. We all have our own interests and concerns.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn110" id="fnref110">110</a></sup>
                  Indeed, for both Subramanyan and Mitter, the relationship that
                  they established with Gombrich’s intellectual structures was
                  precisely one of taking on Gombrich’s schema and correcting it
                  to address the world as they saw it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For Subramanyan, Gombrich provided a vocabulary drawn from the
                  psychology of perception that helped him develop his
                  Santiniketan teacher Nandalal Bose’s ideas about the semiotics
                  of artistic expression (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-52">Fig.&nbsp;100</a>). As Sonal Khullar argues, “Gombrich’s anti-Hegelian art
                  history allowed for the possibility of divergent temporalities
                  for art and for divergent representational forms, both
                  nature-improving and nature-spiritualizing in Riegl’s
                  terms.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn111" id="fnref111">111</a></sup>
                  In other words, Gombrich’s
                  <em>Art and Illusion</em> established the
                  <em>conventional</em> nature of representation, and opened the
                  possibilities of art as language, which Subramanyan adopted in
                  his own pedagogical practice. Appropriating theoretical
                  schemas drawn from both Gombrich and Bose, Subramanyan made
                  his own corrections when teaching “Fundamentals of the Visual
                  Arts” as a world art history course at the Faculty of Fine
                  Arts at the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda from 1959
                  to the 1970s.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, for Partha Mitter, the methodological tools that he
                  learned enabled him to make his own “corrections” to both
                  Gombrich and to art history more generally (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-53">Fig.&nbsp;101</a>). Mitter had wanted to be an artist and attended a few
                  classes at the Calcutta Art School but found it not
                  sufficiently intellectual. Dreaming of going to art school in
                  Paris, he ended up being admitted to an undergraduate
                  programme in history at the School of Oriental and African
                  Studies (SOAS) in 1962, and went to London instead, where he
                  painted and did drawings in the evenings after classes at St
                  Martin’s School of Art. His very first lecture was delivered
                  by Ernst Gombrich in the General History Lecture Series at
                  Senate House, London University, which Mitter comments, “just
                  bowled me over for his radical rethinking of Hegel … He gave
                  me a very new insight. I started looking for his books, then
                  read <em>Art and Illusion</em>, which was central to my work”
                  (<a href="#issues-issue-index-issue-20-london-asia-and-the-slade-archives-p-54">Fig.&nbsp;102</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Inspired by the lecture and his other interactions with
                  Gombrich, Mitter eventually approached Gombrich to ask if he
                  would supervise his dissertation on Paul Klee. Not considering
                  himself an art historian, Gombrich demurred, suggesting that
                  Mitter study with Anthony Blunt, but then posed a question to
                  Mitter that would prove pivotal. “You know,” said Gombrich, “I
                  find the aesthetic principles and taste of Hindu temple
                  sculpture and architecture very difficult to come to terms
                  with and assimilate.” Not understanding his own schemas,
                  Gombrich asked Mitter if he would want to try to answer that
                  question in his dissertation and offered to supervise him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I was at SOAS at a very important colonial moment”, Mitter
                  comments, noting that it was populated by “ex-colonial
                  teachers, army officers, orientalists”, who, although
                  friendly, were “very patronising in a very kind way”. Between
                  Gombrich’s unanswered question and Mitter’s immediate
                  environment at SOAS, he began thinking about the intellectual
                  structures of colonialism and racism, which eventually led to
                  him teaching a course on the ideology of racism, giving a
                  guest lecture on Indian art in Susan Hiller’s class at the
                  Slade around 1965.&nbsp;From 1965–1970, Mitter pursued a PhD with
                  Gombrich through a joint degree at the University of London
                  between SOAS and the Warburg Institute, and his doctoral
                  dissertation became the book
                  <em>Much Maligned Monsters: A History of European Reactions to
                    Indian Art</em>
                  (Fig.&nbsp;103)<em>.</em> Published in 1977, one year before Edward
                  Said’s <em>Orientalism</em> (1978),
                  <em>Much Maligned Monsters</em> revealed the colonial schemas
                  that demonized Indian art within European ways of knowing.

                  Drawing transversal connections and comparisons between the
                  histories of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Taiwan,
                  Indonesia, Singapore, Nigeria, Sudan, Uganda, Britain, and
                  beyond, this feature offers a methodological proposition for
                  writing multi-perspectival or <em>worlded</em> global art
                  histories.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn112" id="fnref112">112</a></sup>
                  Additionally, it reveals the contrapuntal histories of the
                  Slade, partially restoring what Hammad Nasar calls the
                  “empire-shaped hole” in British history and the British
                  imagination.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn113" id="fnref113">113</a></sup>

                <p>
                  This feature situates itself between a worlded global art
                  history and archival studies, in order to offer a
                  methodological proposition that experiments with new forms of
                  collaboration and knowledge co-creation that are necessarily
                  generous and generative, working across archives, countries,
                  languages, and disciplinary boundaries. It seeks to read and
                  give form to archives both against and along the grain,
                  co-constituting histories at their points of
                  friction—generative intellectual spaces that, like rubbing two
                  sticks together, produce sparks that can burn down or burn
                  brightly. We use this metaphor, which refers creatively to
                  Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing’s theorization of friction, to think
                  through what it means to write a worlded global art history
                  that contends with empire critically, narrating yet decentring
                  histories that are both centripetal and centrifugal, caught
                  between empire and decolonization.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn114" id="fnref114">114</a></sup>

                  This feature is part of the “London, Asia” project at the Paul
                  Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art headed by Sarah
                  Victoria Turner and Hammad Nasar. It is a project that plays
                  with scale, zooming in to the level of the urban and out to
                  encompass the region, in order to shift the lenses through
                  which we see transnational and transcultural histories. In
                  this way, the nation is rendered as a body of topics for
                  discussion rather than as a fundamental organizational
                  category, allowing us to find new ways of connecting the dots,
                  new through lines and transversals that give birth to new
                  histories. Following the “London, Asia, Art, Worlds”
                  conference which took place in May and June 2021,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn115" id="fnref115">115</a></sup>
                  and a forthcoming series of workshops on art pedagogy
                  co-organized by the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British
                  Art and Asia Art Archive, we will create a second part of this
                  “Animating the Archive” feature in
                  <em>British Art Studies</em>, which will address the period
                  from the 1960s to the 1990s. We hope that you will join us in
                  this ambitious endeavour to rethink how we write art history,
                  and perhaps more importantly at this moment in history, how we

                          Liz Bruchet is a researcher, archive curator, and oral
                          historian, and Senior Lecturer in Archival Studies in
                          the Department of Information Studies, UCL. Her
                          research focuses on the records and recordkeeping
                          practices of visual arts organisations, with
                          particular interests in the interconnections between
                          archives and curation, as well as the biographies of
                          archives, “orphan” objects and records, and the value
                          of these for curation. Her MA in Curatorial Studies
                          (UBC) drew on her experience in museum and gallery
                          work in Canada, and her PhD in Archival Studies from
                          the University of Brighton developed a conceptual
                          framework for understanding the tangled relationships
                          between archival and curatorial practices. She has led
                          oral history projects for institutions such as the
                          Association for Art History and the Paul Mellon Centre
                          for Studies in British Art, and prior to her current
                          role, was Researcher and Archive Curator at the Slade
                          School of Fine Art, UCL, for which she has developed a
                          range of collaborative research, digitisation, and
                          exhibition projects. Recent publications include

                        University College London (UCL) was founded in 1826 by
                        nonconformists as a liberal and secular alternative to
                        the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. The founders
                        and supporters including the poet Thomas Campbell, a
                        lawyer and politician Henry Brougham, intellectual James
                        Mill, and abolitionist Zachary Macaulay, and according
                        to UCL calendars of the period, the founding
                        abolitionist figures were the reason behind the school’s
                        inclusive policies. See also Negley Harte, John North,

                        archives in which records are understood to be created
                        and then archived into a static state from which
                        evidence can be retrieved, the records continuum model
                        in archival theory posits that records are in an ongoing
                        state of activation, reactivation, and authentication
                        along a continuum of creation, capture, organization,
                        and pluralization. It is in this sense that archival
                        records can be conceptualized as always in the process
                        of becoming. Sue McKemmish, “Placing Records Continuum

                        Négritude was a political and cultural response to
                        French colonialism in Africa and the Caribbean that
                        asserted the importance and humanity of Black culture as
                        a response to the dehumanization of colonialism. Major
                        proponents included Léopold Sédar Senghor and Aimé
                        Césaire. It has been critiqued, most notably by Frantz
                        Fanon, as not adequately departing from the logics of
                        European colonialism. Fanon, “On National Culture”.

                        established, as it is included in the document. The next
                        major change to the curriculum came in 1964, when the
                        course was discontinued, due to a similar programme
                        being offered at the Tejgaon Polytechnic Institute.

                        Despite hewing closely to the Calcutta curriculum, Selim

                        landscape and figures, especially labourers and
                        artisans, which fostered an engagement with Bengali

                        Zaidi developed these positions in the context of
                        working with Mark Ritter Sponenburgh, an American
                        sculptor who was the first principal of the National
                        College of Arts, Lahore, and who introduced the NCA’s
                        modern curriculum in 1958. Sponenburgh was a champion of
                        arts and crafts in Pakistan, and was known for his work
                        on the Swat Valley. See, for example, Mark Sponenburgh,
                        “Folk Arts of the Swat Valley”,
                        <em>Contemporary Arts in Pakistan</em> 2, no. 2 (Summer
                        1961). This was not purely Sponenburgh’s initiative,
                        however, and Zaidi took credit for her accomplishment,
                        mentioning that “I got the subject of ‘Art and Craft’
                        made compulsory up to the 8th Class in all Schools of
                        Pakistan” on her CV of ca. 1965. National College of
                        Arts, Lahore Archives, Personal File of Ms. Jamila

                        Ali first became temporary principal in 1961, after
                        Sponenburgh’s departure due to his wife’s cancer

                        <em>Worlding</em>, or the situated-ness of world-making,
                        takes the shift from the adjectival form world to the
                        gerund worlding in order to invoke the labour and
                        contingency of world-making. This situated-ness, which
                        is necessarily linked to the <em>work</em> of art,
                        offers a corrective to top–down constructions of the
                        global that fail to account for the production of
                        multiple, sometimes competing, and often intertwined
                        worlds. The starting point of the discourse on worlding
                        (<em>welten</em>) has conventionally been philosopher
                        Martin Heidegger’s essay, “The Origins of the Work of
                        Art” (1950). In the intervening years, this concept has
                        been appropriated, expanded on, and deconstructed by
                        thinkers from postcolonial theorist Gayatri Spivak
                        (1985) to literary scholar Pheng Cheah, and
                        anthropologists Marisol de la Cadena and Mario Blaser.

                  This article builds on my research and experience as
                  co-curator of <em>THIRTY QUEENS</em>, a hybrid
                  exhibition-event, which took place at the contemporary
                  artist-led space LOWER.GREEN, Norwich in 2019, exploring the
                  artist Gustav Metzger’s time in King’s Lynn in the 1950s.
                  King’s Lynn laid the foundations for Metzger’s later fusion of
                  art and activism, and movement from painted or sculpted
                  objects towards event-like works. But it was also in King’s
                  Lynn that Metzger learned how to live, work, and practise as
                  an artist outside of a cosmopolitan centre and was compelled
                  by the imaginative purchase of the historical and the
                  antiquarian. Throughout his time in the town, Metzger scraped
                  a living dealing in furniture, antiques, and books, briefly
                  taking on a shop where, as Thirty Queens, he would also
                  organise selling exhibitions. This mixed-economy (not strictly
                  non-commercial) model of artistic production and distribution
                  is an unusual and useful case study to think about British art
                  of the 1950s outside of the capital. With Thirty Queens,
                  Metzger was trying to position himself not as peripheral but
                  as an extension of a London-centric British art scene, while
                  providing a platform for regional art and antiquity.
                  Structured around sites of significance, this article presents
                  the first comprehensive account of Metzger’s time in King’s
                  Lynn, and maps his concerns onto those of contemporary
                  artistic and curatorial practices in the region. It
                  demonstrates that Thirty Queens provides a lens onto the
                  recent history of British artist-led and alternative art
                  spaces. Drawing together archival research, interviews and
                  oral histories, exhibition histories, and field trips, this
                  article makes use of Mathieu Copeland’s recently published
                  volume of Metzger’s writing and finds particularising,
                  anecdotal detail in Clive Phillpot’s conversations with Gustav
                  Metzger recorded in 1997 for the National Sound Archive.
                  Centring the artist’s voice, this article argues that it is
                  necessary to extend the characterisation of Metzger’s work to
                  include that of artist-dealer, artist-curator, and
                  artist-activist. What emerges, also, is a picture of the
                  artist at work, often in poverty and unwavering in his
                  political convictions.

                <p>
                  The celebrated artist-activist Gustav Metzger made his
                  iconoclastic—and iconic—entry into post-war public life in
                  Britain with his
                  <em>Recreation of First Public Demonstration of
                    Auto-Destructive Art</em>
                  on London’s South Bank in 1961. First demonstrated a year
                  earlier at Temple Gallery, Sloane Street, film-maker Harold
                  Liversidge’s 1963 documentation of a recreation, titled
                  <em>Auto-Destructive Art: The Activities of G Metzger</em>,
                  shows Metzger, wearing a military jacket, helmet, and gas
                  mask, painting, flinging and spraying acid onto nylon (<a href="#jpwatts-fig1">Figs. 1</a>
                  and <a href="#jpwatts-fig2">2</a>). Set against the backdrop
                  of the City of London, it announces Metzger’s focus as an
                  itinerant cosmopolitan artist: the centralised seat of
                  imperial capitalist power. Yet, it was in King’s Lynn, in the
                  rural county of Norfolk, where he lived from 1953&nbsp;to 1959,
                  that Metzger first experimented with what would become the
                  “auto-destructive” technique in his live-work-warehouse studio
                  on St Nicholas Street at the heart of the medieval old town.

                  Disarmament (CND) branch, the Committee of 100, and
                  self-organised protests against the redevelopment of medieval
                  wards in the town, Metzger memorably claimed: “Everything I
                  know about activism I learnt in King’s Lynn”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  Activism would become central to Metzger’s practice, but there
                  were other lessons learnt in King’s Lynn that will be explored
                  in this article: how to live, work, and practise as an artist
                  outside of a metropolitan centre, as well as the imaginative
                  pull and purchase of the historical and the antiquarian that
                  he found so captivating in this rural Norfolk town.

                  Metzger relocated to King’s Lynn from London in the summer of
                  1953 knowing nobody. When he finally left six years later, he
                  claims to have only known a few more people. He first
                  encountered the town when cycling from Norwich to the
                  Midlands. Where the Brecklands opens into the Fens, he passed
                  by a “splendid” medieval town that reminded him of
                  Antwerp—lowlands, by a river, calm—and decided to stay.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  Metzger had already begun withdrawing from the London orbit of
                  his charismatic former teacher David Bomberg and was
                  increasingly moving away from painting. Embittered by his
                  marginalisation in contemporary histories of the English
                  avant-garde, Bomberg surrounded himself with a group of mostly
                  former students who exhibited together as the Borough Bottega.
                  Increasingly, Metzger—who had been the star pupil—felt the
                  Bottega served only Bomberg’s interests and resolved to quit,
                  hoping, however, to remain friends. This wasn’t to be so.
                  Following an exchange of bluntly worded letters, Bomberg
                  severed ties (by withdrawing, Metzger effectively opted out of
                  becoming what was later called the School of London, which
                  included his peers Frank Auerbach and Leon Kossoff).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  Bruised, Metzger spoke of King’s Lynn as a retreat—an
                  opportunity to reconsolidate resources and ideas: “It was a
                  very important time for me,” he later recalled. “I was
                  building up my energy. Separated from London. It did me
                  good.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a year, Metzger obtained a lease on St Nicholas House,
                  “a magnificent building”, he told the curator Lynda Morris,
                  “next to the Tuesday Market. It had a 16th-century wooden door
                  and gabled roof. It was in good condition and dry”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  Flanked by handsome commercial buildings, and in Nikolaus
                  Pevsner’s estimation, “[o]ne of the most splendid open spaces
                  in provincial England”, the Tuesday Market Place was where
                  Metzger scraped a living dealing in furniture, antiques, and
                  books.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  Although for the first few years in King’s Lynn he ceased to
                  produce art altogether—an anticipation perhaps of the
                  “straitened circumstances” in 1969 that prevented him from
                  undertaking any speaking, singing, or dancing engagements for
                  the remainder of the year, his later call for artists to
                  withdraw their labour in 1974 and the subsequent “Art Strike”
                  of 1977—he began to paint seriously again from 1956 onwards,
                  creating squally, hard-edged works on a mild steel ground
                  before the first auto-destructive experiments.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The year 1956 was a significant one for Metzger. Not only did
                  he begin to paint again but, merely a minute-long walk away
                  from St Nicholas, south of the Tuesday Market Place, he also
                  took on a shop in a broad sweep of Georgian terraces at Queen
                  Street. Here, as well as selling art, antiques, and books, he
                  began hosting, however briefly, selling contemporary art
                  exhibitions. Located at 30 Queen Street, the shop, a mixed-use
                  space, long since redeveloped into flats, became Thirty Queens
                  gallery when it hosted a series of three formal and informal
                  exhibitions, and became a satellite venue for an offsite
                  exhibition organised by Metzger in the fourteenth-century
                  crypt at Clifton House, several doors down at 17 Queen Street.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first of these formal exhibitions, a group show of recent
                  sculptural work by Eduardo Paolozzi, William Turnbull, and
                  Anthony Hatwell, opened on 19 July 1956, coinciding with the
                  King’s Lynn Festival.
                  <em>Treasures from East Anglian Churches</em>, which opened on
                  27 July 1957, formed part of that year’s festival programme
                  and featured thirty-six church monuments and artefacts
                  collected from around the region that had been damaged,
                  removed, or displaced in the period between the Reformation
                  and the end of the Commonwealth. Between these two
                  exhibitions, in December 1956, Metzger showed paintings of the
                  obscure local artist and practising witch Monica English. When
                  the <em>This is Tomorrow</em> exhibition opened at the
                  Whitechapel Gallery on 9 August 1956, Metzger also collected
                  the event’s advertising posters—designed by artists such as
                  Richard Hamilton, Victor Pasmore, and Sarah Jackson in one of
                  twelve participating groups—to display at Thirty Queens for
                  its duration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Metzger had little artistic context in King’s Lynn but his
                  efforts drew in major London-based artists with gallery
                  representation, engaging with the white heat of the post-war
                  avant-garde, while also giving opportunities to regional
                  artists. He also evidently engaged with early modern regional
                  histories—I refer to it as Metzger’s antiquarianism—that was
                  no doubt influenced by living in a county densely populated by
                  historic ecclesiastical and commercial architecture. Nowhere
                  is this more evident than in King’s Lynn. With Thirty Queens,
                  Metzger was trying to position himself not as peripheral—“out
                  in the sticks” as they say in Norfolk—but as an extension of a
                  London-centric British art scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My sustained engagement with this history of the gallery began
                  in 2018 when the curator Nell Croose Myhill and I began
                  planning to restage aspects of the
                  <em>Treasures from East Anglian Churches</em> exhibition at
                  LOWER.GREEN, an artist-led space that I ran in Norwich,
                  Norfolk in a former charity shop and a one-time artist studio,
                  from July 2018 to February 2019. Located in a brutalist
                  shopping centre earmarked for contested demolition and
                  redevelopment, the programme of eight exhibitions, as well as
                  talks, events, and a residency, was necessarily of a fixed
                  duration. The
                  <em>Treasures from East Anglian Churches</em> exhibition,
                  which we titled <em>THIRTY QUEENS</em> in our programme when
                  the exhibition expanded to incorporate talks and events
                  dealing with Metzger’s wider activities in King’s Lynn, would,
                  fittingly, be the gallery’s final exhibition (<a href="#jpwatts-fig3">Figs. 3</a>
                  and <a href="#jpwatts-fig4">4</a>).

                  LOWER.GREEN’s programme provided exhibition opportunities for
                  Norwich-based and international artists, typically developing
                  and amplifying thematics presented by histories of the region
                  as they interfaced with current concerns of contemporary art.
                  Networked, experimental and engaged with local histories,
                  Metzger’s Thirty Queens was an inspiration. While Metzger’s
                  own art practice was cross-disciplinary—collapsing activist
                  into dealer, dealer into curator—the site of production,
                  framing, and display of art were fluid and interchangeable
                  too. This mixed-economy model (not strictly non-commercial) of
                  artistic production and distribution is an unusual and useful
                  model to rethink British art of the 1950s, decentring
                  attention from London to consider venues, spaces, and
                  practices of experimental art operating outside of the
                  capital. Metzger’s work in King’s Lynn spoke to our situation
                  in complex and suggestive ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thirty Queens also provides a lens on to the recent history—a
                  particular interest of ours—of British artist-led and
                  alternative art spaces, not only in terms of curatorial
                  methods but also in terms of alternative economies for art
                  production and display located in Norwich, but still linked
                  to, London, the marketplace, and artist-dealer models.
                  Clearly, this was important to Metzger and, throughout the
                  1960s and 1970s, he maintained a fiercely antagonistic
                  relation to commercial art galleries. Shortly after his return
                  to London in summer 1959, he began frequenting the artist
                  Brian Robins’ basement cafe at 14 Monmouth Street, popular
                  with artists and writers, where he exhibited paintings
                  produced in King’s Lynn. Later, he began collaborating with
                  artists David Medalla and Marcello Salvadori, curator Paul
                  Keeler, and critic Guy Brett to establish the Centre for
                  Advanced Creative Study, based in Medalla and Keeler’s South
                  Kensington apartment. Its magazine,
                  <em>Signals Newsbulletin</em>, lent its name to the
                  experimental gallery space, Signals, opened by the group in
                  1964 at Wigmore Street.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When Metzger returned to Norfolk for a sustained period of
                  time in 2005 to select the annual EASTinternational exhibition
                  on Lynda Morris’ invitation at the Norwich Gallery, his
                  presence in King’s Lynn had become somewhat of a myth,
                  circulating among the region’s contemporary art
                  community—compelling and strange. What did this figure,
                  central to 1960s London counterculture, <em>do</em> in the
                  sleepy medieval fishing town? In this regard, other
                  contemporary artists and cultural figures were pulled to this
                  part of Eastern England, including the Parisian sound poet
                  Henri Chopin—a sometime collaborator with Metzger—who spent
                  his latter years in the Norfolk market town of Dereham and the
                  Dutch curator Rudi Fuchs—former director of the Van Abbemuseum
                  in Eindhoven and artistic director of <em>documenta 7</em>,
                  among other things—who spent his vacations a mere ten miles
                  north in Fakenham.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lynda Morris’ inspirational attitude of looking east, east
                  away from London, over the English channel, into the
                  Continent, from an east of England position, what she has
                  called “international provincialism”, meant that Fuchs had
                  also been invited to select EASTinternational.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                  Metzger, recalling his time in King’s Lynn, told Morris that
                  he’d relocated there:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    To get away from London but not too far. Far enough to be in
                    another world but I could take the train and be in central
                    London in a couple of hours to visit galleries and friends,
                    and after a couple of days to go back to King’s Lynn.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The train passed through Cambridge where he had started his
                  art studies in 1945; these tracks connected his past life with
                  his present one.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Metzger cultivated a position for himself at the edge. He
                  didn’t feel like socialising. “I had difficulty finding work.
                  I was an outsider,” he said, “I picked peas in the field and I
                  swept up. People would get to know me vaguely, being on the
                  Tuesday Market, once I started dealing. I had a stall with my
                  bits and pieces.” Speaking in 2005 for the
                  <em>EASTinternational Catalogue</em>, Metzger continued: “The
                  paintings from that time are in storage and the drawings. One
                  day they will be exhibited.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In fact, they had already been exhibited. In June 1960, upon
                  Metzger’s return to London, they were shown at Temple Gallery
                  (alongside the first lecture/demonstration of auto-destructive
                  art) but subsequently stored away in 1965 above a garage at
                  the home of a relative in North London, where they were kept
                  until 2010. Among those drawings exhibited in the
                  documenta-Halle at <em>dOCUMENTA (13)</em> in 2012 as part of
                  <em>Too Extreme: A Selection of Drawings by Gustav Metzger Made
                    from 1945 to 1959/60</em>
                  were paintings on steel completed just before the first
                  auto-destructive experiments.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                  Together with Metzger’s
                  <em>Re-Creation of the First Public Demonstration of
                    Auto-Destructive Art</em>
                  (1960), these were exhibited again at Haus der Kunst, Munich,
                  in 2015. That same year,
                  <em>Gustav Metzger: Towards Auto-Destructive Art 1950–1962</em>
                  opened at Tate Britain, which featured <em>Re-Creation</em>

                    Art</em>
                  alongside steel paintings, documents of earlier cardboard
                  reliefs, manifestos, and work produced in King’s Lynn. In
                  2011, the curator and writer Mathieu Copeland restaged
                  Metzger’s gesture of re-presenting
                  <em>This is Tomorrow</em> posters by re-presenting facsimiles
                  of the original poster series in the window of David Roberts
                  Art Foundation, London and later on the street side at Circuit
                  Lausanne in 2013. In June 2019, curator Elizabeth Fisher
                  opened
                  <em>Destroy, and You Create: Gustav Metzger in King’s Lynn</em>
                  at the Fermoy Gallery and Red Barn as part of the King’s Lynn
                  Festival. Much of the work shown there was treated and made
                  exhibition-ready at Tate prior to its 2015 exhibition.

                  Our display at LOWER.GREEN in February 2019 was intentionally
                  slight, featuring one object—a thirteenth-century stone corbel
                  selected by Metzger for
                  <em>Treasures from East Anglian Churches</em>—and
                  documents—including the original exhibition catalogue, an
                  early edition of his first auto-destructive manifesto
                  reproduced in <em>dé-collage</em> no. 6, July 1967, a special
                  “Auto Destructive” art issue, and John Cox’s 1959 sequence of
                  photographs of Metzger in his studio at St Nicholas House,
                  reproduced in the <em>Art and Artists</em> “Auto-Destructive”
                  issue, edited in 1966 by the art critic Mario Amaya (<a href="#jpwatts-fig5">Fig. 5</a>).

                  Metzger preferred actions and performances to objects (an
                  approach that informed his selection of works for
                  <em>EASTinternational</em> in 2005, famously billed as “the
                  art exhibition without the art”). Our condensed display,
                  though not secondary, was an accompaniment to two days of
                  events in the gallery. This included an afternoon of talks and
                  tours exploring themes of art and destruction in Norfolk,
                  including a presentation of research that traced the objects
                  from <em>Treasures from East Anglian Churches</em>, a walking
                  tour led by Professor Sandy Heslop of iconoclasm in three
                  Norwich churches, and a presentation by Dr Sarah Lowndes on
                  artist-led spaces, meanwhile use, and regeneration. The
                  following afternoon, Mathieu Copeland, then editing
                  <em>Gustav Metzger: Writings</em>, shared his experience of
                  working with Metzger’s prose and Lynda Morris gave an
                  illustrated talk about her time working with Metzger as part
                  of <em>EASTinternational</em>. Afterwards, Copeland and Morris
                  joined in conversation. Copeland’s book, published by JPR
                  Ringier in October 2019, is a major achievement in Metzger
                  scholarship.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  Documents relating to Metzger’s activity in King’s Lynn, in
                  particular the catalogue for
                  <em>Treasures from East Anglian Churches</em>, were shared
                  with us by Copeland in the research process of our exhibition.

                  A number of buildings and sites around the medieval centre of
                  King’s Lynn—most of which remain today—had significance for
                  Metzger: St Nicholas House, Tuesday Market Place, 30 Queen
                  Street, and 26 Pilot Street in the North End (<a href="#jpwatts-fig6">Figs. 6</a>, <a href="#jpwatts-fig7">7</a>,
                  <a href="#jpwatts-fig8">8</a>, and
                  <a href="#jpwatts-fig9">9</a>). These became more or less
                  significant at different times throughout his six-year stay in
                  the town. St Nicholas House, however, was a constant. In
                  spring 1954, shortly after his arrival the previous summer, he
                  took on a six-year lease of the property, which expired a year
                  after he’d returned to London. Across the road, Metzger ran a
                  stall on the Tuesday Market Place on and off from around 1954,
                  except for a brief hiatus in 1956—for around six months
                  perhaps—when he opened shop at 30 Queen Street (occasionally
                  he would also trade at Market Hill in Cambridge on Saturdays).

                  Later, in the midst of protests against the destructive
                  redevelopment of the North End, Metzger purchased a house,
                  which, like St Nicholas, he kept for a short period after he
                  returned to London. Briefly between London and King’s Lynn,
                  ultimately he let both properties go when he committed to
                  remaining in the capital. A press photograph for the
                  <em>Lynn News and Advertiser</em> places Metzger on Pilot
                  Street discussing redevelopment plans with the president of
                  the Chamber of Commerce and John Cox’s photographic series of
                  1959 shows Metzger, who by this time had returned to London,
                  conducting experiments with acid on nylon inside his studio at
                  St Nicholas House (<a href="#jpwatts-fig10">Figs. 10</a> and

                  In the years prior to King’s Lynn, Metzger had lived with the
                  support of a Haendler Trust grant in 1946, which he had gained
                  with the help of David Bomberg (extended later on the
                  recommendation of Frank Dobson). When in Antwerp, he received
                  a grant from the Jewish community to study, which enabled him
                  to travel extensively on his stateless passport, and on his
                  return he received another Haendler Trust grant (engineered
                  through Bomberg, with the help of Jacob Epstein). When this
                  last grant ceased in 1951, he began the first of many casual
                  labouring jobs on building sites and on the land alongside
                  painting. It was on the land, picking peas, that Metzger first
                  found work on arrival in King’s Lynn. Much like today, in the
                  summer, such work—hard and poorly paid—was readily available.
                  When winter came, opportunities to work were few and far
                  between. “It was difficult,” Metzger recalls. “I had no money.
                  I found it hard to find work. Any work.” In the early part of
                  1954, he found a full-time day job in the labour exchange as a

                <p>
                  At some point in spring 1954, Metzger noticed a large, old
                  property standing vacant on St Nicholas Street. In the
                  sixteenth century, many houses along this street, known then
                  as Woolmarket, contained shops used by the overflow of the
                  Tuesday Market. Dwellings were mixed with both storage and
                  shop space. Back then, the river coursed more closely to the
                  west of the marketplace, around the docks. A “turnkey” at the
                  mouth of the River Ouse, goods passed in, through, and out of
                  King’s Lynn into the Midlands and across the English Channel
                  to Norway and Spain, a legacy of which are the abundance of
                  warehouses in the town dating right back to the late medieval
                  period. “Indeed,” Vanessa Parker writes in
                  <em>The Making of King’s Lynn</em>, “it must be unique for a
                  town to have preserved so much visual evidence of its past
                  commercial activity.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
                  Constructed at this time, and reworked in the seventeenth and
                  eighteenth centuries, the property Metzger had seen, known as
                  St Nicholas House, would have belonged to a wealthy merchant
                  or a prosperous retailer.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Metzger convinced the estate agents to put him in touch with
                  the current owner, an elderly solicitor based in Golden
                  Square, London. After a year of negotiations, he was granted
                  the lease and had even been allowed to move in before
                  completion, paying rent of £1 per week.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>
                  “The owner was clever,” Metzger recalls, “and thought it is
                  better someone is in there if things go wrong.” The landlord,
                  he continues, “was concerned with maintaining the heritage of
                  the building. The antiquity. He thought an artist was an ideal
                  tenant.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>
                  This is a striking example of a mixed-use live-work-storage
                  space that mutually benefited both the landlord and the
                  artist, in this instance framed as aesthetic connoisseur,
                  which Metzger was happy to leverage (<a href="#jpwatts-fig12">Fig. 12</a>).

                  Today, 11 St Nicholas Street, as it is known, has been
                  converted into flats. Following extensive restorations in
                  1972, it was amalgamated with the neighbouring building as the
                  Tudor Rose Hotel, at around the time 9 St Nicholas Street was
                  demolished. Pevsner pays particular attention to the
                  “excellent traceried door. It has five vertical panels with
                  early Perp tracery patterns”. The internal hall, he notes, has
                  an early sixteenth-century stack with double-roll moulded
                  stone jambs to the fireplace.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>
                  Metzger recognised its potential:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    One of the rooms I decided would be ideal for a studio.
                    There was one window. The rest were walls. It looked on to
                    the vicarage of the garden in front. Across I could see St
                    Nicholas. A beautiful small medieval church. It didn’t
                    frighten me. It was very modest … Next door I arranged my
                    sleeping room, which was smaller. Beyond that was an
                    enormous room with a timber roof going back hundreds of
                    years where I stored my things.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Across the road, adjoining at the north, was the Tuesday
                  Market Place, where, soon after moving in he decided to
                  become—like the owners identified by Vanessa Parker in
                  <em>The Making of King's Lynn</em> generations before—a
                  dealer. Unlike his sixteenth- and seventeenth-century
                  predecessors, however, Metzger would begin dealing in junk,
                  not rich materials. “I specialised in nothing,” Metzger
                  recalls. “I would go to the auction and buy a box for five
                  shillings and wheel it into my store through the door on a
                  wheelbarrow.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup>
                  Metzger would open the box, clean up the items as required,
                  then cart them back out across the road in a wheelbarrow to
                  his stall where everything and anything was for sale.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Week by week he became more knowledgeable of the value of
                  things. “I wasn’t particularly good at it,” he admits, “I
                  would sell books, pictures. Sometimes I would bid on things. I
                  would work on the principle of doubling … I was after 100 per
                  cent profit.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">22</a></sup>
                  To his surprise, people who saw him buy the boxes for 5
                  shillings at auction came to his stall to buy stuff, even
                  though they knew it was marked up. Metzger lived a lean
                  existence. He was a poor artist-dealer living in the remains
                  of a rich merchant’s house, who nonetheless—like some
                  Baudelairian ragpicker—learnt the machinations of capitalist
                  economy:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    I didn’t need much money. I didn’t have much money. In all
                    those years I barely managed to exist. You travel further to
                    buy. You invest money. I had no money. I was gaining
                    practical experience of capitalism in a way. Low scale.
                    Lower than the proletariat in terms of the income. If I had
                    knowledge I would have done well but I had none.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">23</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Finally, in spring 1956, it became untenable. St Nicholas
                  House, which had been taken on, after all, as a studio space,
                  was not being used for art production, and all his spare time
                  and money went into hustling to stay afloat. Metzger was
                  merely surviving.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then his luck changed. A regular customer at the Tuesday
                  Market—“female, sensitive, middle-class”—who was aware of
                  Metzger’s finances, offered to introduce him to a dealer in
                  surplus goods who’d recently purchased the estate of another
                  bankrupted dealer.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">24</a></sup>
                  Together they travelled to a vast storehouse in the
                  countryside where they struck a deal: Metzger would purchase
                  it all for less than £100 and pay back the debt on a monthly
                  basis at an agreeable rate. The following weekend two lorries
                  arrived with the stock at St Nicholas House where it was
                  carted upstairs into storage before resale. “That saved me,”
                  he recalls, “I could see now I could think of being an artist.
                  I didn’t have to go out buying every week.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">25</a></sup>
                  The stock lasted Metzger for his remaining time in King’s
                  Lynn—in fact, he even left stuff behind when he departed. This
                  deal changed Metzger’s fortunes, effectively enabling him to
                  be an artist again. With time and relative stability, he began
                  painting in earnest, first abstracted images of an old table
                  on reused canvases and old boards, drawings on paper, later
                  exhibited at Temple Gallery, and then increasingly hard-edged
                  abstractions applied with a palette knife onto small pre-cut
                  mild steel sheets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When buyers began going directly to St Nicholas House, Metzger
                  decided to take on a shop. A vacant property in Queen
                  Street—described by Pevsner as “one of the most satisfying
                  Georgian promenades in England”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">26</a></sup>—was available, but required renovation. Taking an initial
                  six-month lease at a reduced rate, his intention was to
                  formally establish an antique shop on a more permanent basis.
                  At this point, he imagined a longer-term future for himself in
                  the town. With the help of his girlfriend, he invested time,
                  energy, and money into a property that ultimately proved
                  beyond his means. “The shop never worked!” Metzger exclaims.
                  “It was never opened. It was a failure. An attempt. I gave up
                  the lease after six months. I said I didn’t want to renew it.
                  I spent too much time decorating it and I gave it up.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">27</a></sup>
                  In the interim, however, the premises were used to stage a
                  number of exhibitions and displays: posters from
                  <em>This is Tomorrow</em>, an exhibition of paintings by
                  Monica English, and an exhibition of new sculpture by William
                  Turnbull, Eduardo Paolozzi, and the relatively unknown artist
                  Anthony Hatwell. A selling exhibition—nothing sold.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Metzger, artist-dealer turned curator, never exhibited his own
                  work at Thirty Queens, nor indeed elsewhere in town. He never
                  received people for studio visits, unless they happened upon
                  it while visiting his stockroom. “I wasn’t interested in
                  exhibiting,” he remembers, “I wasn’t conscious of painting to
                  exhibit.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">28</a></sup>
                  Ironically, it is the upstairs studio of St Nicholas that is
                  the setting for the best-known, early photograph of Metzger in
                  King’s Lynn by John Cox: cast in chiaroscuro by its single
                  leaded window, he gazes into the middle-distance, surrounded
                  by junked books and torn product packaging. Metzger had left
                  King’s Lynn the year previous, before his lease for St
                  Nicholas expired; meanwhile, his invention of what he called
                  “self-destructive art” had developed into “auto-destructive
                  art”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cox, who had photographed Metzger several times with works in
                  London, had travelled from the capital for an afternoon on
                  Metzger’s invitation. Knowing he would arrive on the Wednesday
                  at 11 a.m., Metzger went a week earlier to experiment with
                  materials, eventually arriving at nylon and acid applied with
                  whatever brushes were to hand—including a toilet brush.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">29</a></sup>
                  Metzger was aware of the mediating power of the image. The
                  resulting series of photographs—produced in one take—were only
                  reproduced belatedly six years later, in the special
                  auto-destructive art edition of
                  <em>Art &amp; Artists</em> magazine. Considered too dramatic,
                  too romantic, even sinister, Metzger suppressed the image of
                  himself in his studio surrounded literally by the rejectamenta
                  of his life in King’s Lynn (<a href="#jpwatts-fig13">Fig. 13</a>). The value of Cox’s photographs was that they acted as
                  certification of Metzger’s claim to his innovative technique,
                  not an artistic lifestyle—if indeed these could be separated.
                  By returning to King’s Lynn from London, he consciously
                  embedded an association between his new methods and his
                  earlier life and practice.

                  Sculpture Exhibition at Thirty Queens
                </h1>
                <p>
                  The exhibition, <em>Sculpture at Thirty Queens</em>, featuring
                  recent works of Eduardo Paolozzi, William Turnbull, and
                  Anthony Hatwell, was arranged to mark the opening of Gustav
                  Metzger’s art, antique, and bookshop at 30 Queen Street on 19
                  July 1956. The exhibition opening coincided with the launch of
                  the annual King’s Lynn Festival, although, unlike
                  <em>Treasure from East Anglian Churches</em> the following
                  year, it was not part of the official programme. Open daily
                  from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. until 30 July, admission was free.
                  Thirty Queens was, as a commercial venture, a total failure;
                  nonetheless, of the three displays he hosted there throughout
                  1956, he considered <em>Sculpture at Thirty Queens</em> the
                  “principal exhibition”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">30</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The display was distinctive for its professionalism. In
                  addition to a press release and an accompanying price list of
                  works, Metzger designed cards and an exhibition poster,
                  printed in King’s Lynn (<a href="#jpwatts-fig14">Fig. 14</a>).
                  Strikingly modern in its visual language—two-colour, uppercase
                  sans serif, and gridded lines—the poster design recalls
                  Richard and Terry Hamilton’s work for the Institute of
                  Contemporary Arts (ICA) or Toni del Renzio’s magazine work of
                  the mid-1940s, in particular issue 8 of
                  <em>Polemic</em> journal (<a href="#jpwatts-fig15">Fig. 15</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">31</a></sup>
                  Conscious of the importance of press coverage and critical
                  discourse, when the exhibition opened, Metzger took the
                  unusual step of reviewing it himself: “These Artists are
                  Possessed: They Gamble with Life”, Metzger’s first published
                  writing, appeared in the <em>Lynn News and Advertiser</em> on
                  27 July 1956.

                  Metzger drew on all of his resources to make the exhibition
                  happen. In late summer 1944, he had a chance meeting with
                  Paolozzi at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (earlier that summer
                  Metzger had made the decision to become a sculptor instead of
                  a professional revolutionary). Still a student at the Slade,
                  Paolozzi invited Metzger to visit the art school where he met
                  his peers Nigel Henderson and William Turnbull. Hatwell
                  studied at the Slade several years after Paolozzi and
                  Turnbull; but met Metzger in David Bomberg’s Borough
                  Polytechnic classes of 1945–1946 and became a fellow member&nbsp;
                  of the Borough Bottega.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Paolozzi was Metzger’s deeper interest in the exhibition. By
                  1956, Paolozzi had already participated in the 1952 Venice
                  Biennale <em>New Aspects of British Sculpture</em> exhibition
                  curated by Herbert Read alongside Kenneth Armitage, Lynn
                  Chadwick, and William Turnbull, among others. For Read, these
                  artists’ tortured figures gave expression to the Cold War
                  climate’s “geometry of fear”. The following year, in late
                  1953, while lodging with then director of the ICA Dorothy
                  Morland, Paolozzi learnt to cast small bronze works in a
                  home-made foundry using the lost wax method.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">32</a></sup>
                  During summer 1956, after a period of pursuing textile art and
                  printing, Paolozzi produced ten small sculptures that were
                  exhibited at the Hanover Gallery, some of which were cast at
                  the famous Susse Frères foundry in Paris.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">33</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  All of Paolozzi’s works exhibited at Thirty Queens were
                  produced in 1956. Although there is no known itemised list, of
                  those named in the press release <em>Small Figure</em> was
                  also exhibited at the Hanover Gallery (<a href="#jpwatts-fig16">Fig. 16</a>). As the Hanover exhibition occurred at the same time as
                  <em>This is Tomorrow</em>—9 August until 9 September—then it
                  would seem Paolozzi’s figures had their first display in
                  King’s Lynn. It was the tension of the Paolozzis that appealed
                  to Metzger: “In '56 he was homing in on destruction, violence.
                  It was new work of the lost wax process. Full of violence.
                  Terror. What appealed was the distortion and destruction.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">34</a></sup>
                  The only two other works named in the press release are
                  <em>Head Looking Up</em>, “an image of a man battling with
                  indomitable will against a mechanical hostile environment”,
                  and <em>Black Figure</em>, “made up of steel girders against
                  which life struggles – barely triumphant” (<a href="#jpwatts-fig17">Fig. 17</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">35</a></sup>
                  A sense of the disturbing presence of the gathered “Figures”
                  is conveyed in the spread of Frank Whitford’s later 1971 Tate
                  catalogue on Paolozzi (<a href="#jpwatts-fig18">Fig. 18</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">36</a></sup>

                  Within their respective groups, both Paolozzi and Turnbull
                  participated in <em>This is Tomorrow</em>. Like Paolozzi, in
                  1956 Turnbull also exhibited at the Hanover Gallery, but in
                  the years preceding had shown relatively little. The following
                  year, his solo show of new sculptures and paintings would open
                  at the ICA—perhaps the reason he exhibited earlier work at
                  Thirty Queens.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">37</a></sup>
                  Of the works listed in the press release, two bronzes,
                  <em>Head</em> (1951) and <em>Growth</em> (1949), and
                  <em>Skull</em> (1954), one of four works in plaster, Metzger
                  attributes to “the most refined imagination of the young
                  sculptors; he is a poet using earth instead of words and
                  sound”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">38</a></sup>
                  It is likely Metzger got some of this information wrong (there
                  is misattribution in his listings for
                  <em>Treasures from East Anglian Churches</em>, too). Based on
                  titles, dates, and descriptions, <em>Head</em> is more likely
                  the correctly titled <em>Small Head</em> (<a href="#jpwatts-fig19">Fig. 19</a>); <em>Skull</em> is probably 1953, not 1954; and the work
                  <em>Growth</em>, described as “the kind of geometry presented
                  in a field of growing corn”, is likely to be
                  <em>Torque Upwards</em>.

                  Compared to the younger Anthony Hatwell, both Paolozzi and
                  Turnbull—Paolozzi in particular—were contemporary art stars.
                  Metzger’s bombastic, impresario-like review published in the
                  <em>Lynn News and Advertiser</em> makes plain his enthusiasms.
                  Of the five lines given to Hatwell, it is his draughtsmanship
                  “developed under the guidance of the genius Bomberg”, rather
                  than his cast concrete sculpture on display, that is deemed
                  “superior” to any sculptor under the age of fifty working in
                  Britain (<a href="#jpwatts-fig20">Fig. 20</a>). The
                  sculptures, <em>Reclining Figure</em> among them, are
                  “astonishing for one so young”. As Metzger recalls, the other
                  two questioned who this young sculptor was but were able to be
                  convinced. Discussing the exhibition in 1997, Metzger
                  explained that one impulse for exhibiting Hatwell was a way of
                  “doing good” to Bomberg’s class after he’d withdrawn in 1953:
                  “I wanted to give him a hand”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">39</a></sup>

                  Unlike Paolozzi and Turnbull, whose exhibition histories never
                  feature <em>Sculpture at Thirty Queens</em>, the experience
                  had a big impact for Hatwell, even though subsequently he
                  showed very little and never shook off a monkish aspect
                  inherited from Bomberg. As the art historian Bill Hare has
                  suggested, writing on the occasion of Hatwell’s first solo
                  exhibition at age 82, through an intense process of visual and
                  tactile exploration, he sought to translate Bomberg’s ideals
                  for modern painting into his own sculptural practice,
                  particularly through the mediation of drawing: “Bomberg did
                  not have much consciousness of how sculpture might be made,
                  and did not teach sculpture. I attended his drawing and
                  painting class and tried to interpret a drawing approach into
                  sculpture, which I found very difficult.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">40</a></sup>
                  Bomberg never visited
                  <em>Sculpture Exhibition at Thirty Queens</em>. Is it possible
                  Metzger was trying to demonstrate another way of practising
                  for Hatwell?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Metzger’s <em>Lynn News and Advertiser</em> piece makes the
                  case for skilled, knowing, and intentional abstraction. “There
                  is no doubt,” he writes, “that should any of these artists
                  decide to make a ‘naturalistic head’ it would make any work by
                  an RA [Royal Academician] look as if made of pastry.”
                  Beginning with Auguste Rodin, he outlines a lineage for these
                  modern sculptors that takes in Aristide Maillol, Jacob
                  Epstein, Pablo Picasso, Henry Moore, and Alberto
                  Giacometti—all of whom had broken with naturalism to distort
                  the human form. In the work of Rodin, “Heads, lips and legs
                  are left out or so badly mutilated as to become
                  unrecognisable”. Rodin, he writes, “breaks open the closed
                  form, emphasises the touch of the sculptor on the clay”.
                  “Unless one knows the work of the above-mentioned artists,”
                  Metzger concludes, “it is almost impossible to assess the work
                  of the three sculptors on view at 30 Queen Street, King’s
                  Lynn.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">41</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here, Metzger, however programmatically, is also publicly
                  working through his own understanding of human form in
                  sculpture, a much broader conversation within contemporary art
                  in Britain and on the Continent, particularly among a younger
                  generation of artists and critics around art informel and the
                  humanism of Michel Tapié and Jean Dubuffet. Metzger makes
                  Paolozzi’s and Turnbull’s sculptures into contemporary
                  devotional figures striving against a hostile technocratic
                  environment. Melodramatic, existential, nearing nonsensical,
                  Metzger ends the article: “These artists are possessed. Driven
                  to surrender their volition, they gamble with life and with
                  art—guided only by the knowledge that it is the extreme
                  direction that leads out of chaos.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">42</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  People came to the exhibition. Nothing sold. “They could have
                  bought a Paolozzi for £60,” Metzger quipped years later: “If I
                  had the money I would have bought one. Put it into
                  auction.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">43</a></sup>
                  Metzger lost money organising the exhibition—money that
                  otherwise would have gone into the shop. If the exhibition was
                  about positioning himself within a milieu, he never broke into
                  the ranks of the Independent Group, despite carrying out
                  studio visits.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">44</a></sup>
                  He had, of course, organised exhibitions with the Bottega, but
                  nothing as ambitious and as focused as this. If it shattered
                  his ambitions to become an art dealer, he would become
                  increasingly hostile, not to galleries per se, but to the
                  commercial gallery system—aligning himself with artist-led,
                  non-institutional spaces.

                  On exactly the same date that <em>This is Tomorrow</em> opened
                  at the Whitechapel Gallery, 9 August 1956, Gustav Metzger
                  pasted up the posters advertising it, designed by the
                  participants, in the window of 30 Queen Street, King’s Lynn.
                  They remained in place for a month, until 9 September, when

                  who had exhibited at Thirty Queens the previous month. Half of

                  Each of the twelve groups, in addition to their exhibits,
                  produced a poster. For the catalogue—designed by Edward
                  Wright—groups also submitted a layout of their floor plan with
                  an accompanying statement and a photograph of themselves.
                  Details of posters were reproduced in some of the catalogue
                  entries. Posters were pasted up on the exterior entrance walls
                  of the gallery. The curator of the exhibition, Theo Crosby, a
                  trained architect, also exhibited in a group. This was one of
                  many collapses—designer-curator-artist—guiding the project,
                  which, for Crosby, was an opportunity to address the limits
                  imposed on the participants’ fields through specialist
                  practices and to overcome the “purity of media, golden
                  proportions, and unambiguous iconologies” that had separated
                  them out.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">47</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>This is Tomorrow</em> proved to be one of the most popular
                  exhibitions at the Whitechapel that year, attracting 19,341
                  visitors.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">48</a></sup>
                  Metzger himself made repeat visits, taking the train from
                  King’s Lynn into London. If 1956 was the year Metzger
                  committed to being an artist, then he needed to be informed.
                  His acquaintance with Turnbull and Paolozzi—whose work he
                  admired in particular—would certainly have been a draw. “That
                  was a time,” he remembered, “when I was very much in
                  interaction with London and very interested in contemporary
                  art through magazines.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">49</a></sup>
                  Metzger paid close attention to what the critics wrote and
                  would have been aware of the cutting-edge technological
                  discourse that informed <em>This is Tomorrow</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is not clear how Metzger obtained his poster set. Metzger
                  told the curator Mathieu Copeland that he removed them from
                  hoardings around the city. Discussing the display in 1997,
                  Metzger doesn’t state where he sourced them, but he certainly
                  had a full set. Copeland’s poetic image of Metzger tearing
                  posters from hoardings—ragged, layered, and accreted with the
                  grime of the city—and returning them by train to his King’s
                  Lynn shop for bootleg display is consistent with his later
                  ideas, articulated in the manifestos, of the artistic value of
                  paper cuttings and scraps of fabric deposited on the streets
                  of Soho. These “as found” ephemeral media, Metzger writes,
                  “are as worthy of preservation as any material that has come
                  down from the past”. In an article of 1962, published in
                  <em>ARK: Journal of the Royal College of Art</em>, titled
                  “Machine, Auto-Creative, and Auto-Destructive Art”, he lists
                  techniques that may be employed in the production of machine
                  art:

                    So-called waste or rubbish is collected, usually from the
                    street, and exhibited in the same condition as it is found.
                    The artist may use adhesives or other means to hold the work
                    together.

                  We know these techniques were employed in the early 1960s, by
                  which time Metzger was seeking to push them further, but
                  perhaps, and we can only speculate, this is a
                  post-rationalisation of the act of displaying the posters in
                  King’s Lynn.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Metzger’s recollection of the decision is far more prosaic.
                  Already he had the lease for 30 Queen Street and it was empty.
                  It was in the process of being decorated. He had wallpaper
                  adhesive paste to hand. “I thought, well, I have these
                  posters, so I put them in the window and inside. It was never
                  an exhibition in the sense that people would come to look at
                  the posters.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">51</a></sup>
                  There was little reaction, he recalls, but people saw it—it
                  must have stimulated discussion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If this was not an exhibition then perhaps it might be more
                  accurately described as a display. The posters had
                  significance for Metzger: their disintegration as indifferent
                  matter in the warp and weft of the city’s visual environment
                  was arrested by their display. Posters are mass-produced
                  objects designed to circulate. Decontextualised, away from the
                  city, these cutting-edge symbols of futurity—so many
                  incursions—were afforded attention in the medieval old town.
                  Metzger’s gesture was certainly not a restaging of
                  <em>This is Tomorrow</em>. It was the essential fanatical pop
                  act: these posters were a way for Metzger to occupy space
                  while identifying ideologically, and aligning himself. They
                  promote a tomorrow to come. When Mathieu Copeland restaged
                  Metzger’s gesture—first in the window at David Roberts Art
                  Foundation in 2011 and then on the street side at Circuit
                  Lausanne in 2013—he elevated a display into an exhibition (<a href="#jpwatts-fig25">Figs. 25</a>
                  and <a href="#jpwatts-fig26">26</a>).

                  Copeland’s restaging reminds us that Metzger’s first public
                  demonstration of auto-destructive art was in itself a
                  <em>re-creation</em>. In his “Second Manifesto” of March 1960,
                  he states that “Auto-destructive art <em>re-enacts</em> the
                  obsession with destruction, / the pummelling to which
                  individuals and masses are subjected”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">52</a></sup>
                  A separation between event and representation is implicit in
                  Metzger’s thinking. As the posters and catalogue were the
                  focal point for the Whitechapel’s archival exhibition
                  revisiting <em>This is Tomorrow</em> in 2011, so they are
                  objects that narrate further exhibition histories building
                  upon exhibition histories. Through these posters and Metzger’s
                  gesture, multiple displays are collected.

                  Unlike other exhibitions organised by Gustav Metzger in King’s
                  Lynn—of artists with some profile, influence, or which map
                  onto nascent themes in his practice—<em>Exhibition of Paintings by Monica English</em>
                  at Thirty Queens in December 1956 is somewhat confounding (<a href="#jpwatts-fig27">Fig. 27</a>). There is little trace of English in archives or in
                  collections of post-war contemporary art, no publications in
                  specialist art bookshops, aside from a small lot of undated
                  works sold by the Norfolk auction house Keys in 2011.
                  Mystical, neo-primitive fantasy scenes of cavorting horses are
                  rendered in chalk-tinted charcoal; a glowering Palmer-esque
                  moon lights an ancient grove (<a href="#jpwatts-fig28">Figs. 28</a>, <a href="#jpwatts-fig29">29</a>,
                  <a href="#jpwatts-fig30">30</a>,
                  <a href="#jpwatts-fig31">31</a>, and
                  <a href="#jpwatts-fig32">32</a>). Similar to other exhibitions
                  at Thirty Queens, there is no known photographic documentation
                  of English’s installation, nor catalogue of works, which makes
                  it unclear whether the lot at Keys is characteristic.
                  English’s inclusion in the programme raises more questions
                  than answers, disrupting a neat art-historical narrative. What
                  drew Metzger to English’s work?

                  Intriguingly, where English does show up is in the literature
                  of modern pagan witchcraft, including sleuth-style websites
                  and more academic sources. The fullest account is given by
                  Michael Howard, a respected practitioner of ritual magic and
                  author on esoteric topics. From 1976 until his death in 2015,
                  Howard was editor of <em>The Cauldron</em>, an international
                  magazine on witchcraft, Wicca, ancient and modern paganism,
                  magic, and folklore.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53">53</a></sup>
                  Howard’s 2004 article on English, titled “A Very English
                  Witch”, begins by noting that one of her pencil and charcoal
                  drawings, of the Greek god Pan, was reproduced as a plate in
                  Cottie A. Burland’s 1966 study of “magical practice today”,
                  <em>The Magical Arts</em> (<a href="#jpwatts-fig33">Fig. 33</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54">54</a></sup>
                  Burland is an intriguing character: employed as curator in the
                  Department of Ethnography at the British Museum, he published
                  widely on the pre-Hispanic culture of Latin America and
                  so-called “primitive art”. As well as being a member of the
                  Royal Anthropological Institute, he was a member of the
                  British Society of Aesthetics and was a regular contributor to
                  <em>Art Review</em>.

                  Howard writes that in the late 1970s he’d seen Burland give a
                  talk in which he referred again to the work of English.
                  Burland, when Howard spoke to him after the talk, confirmed
                  that he’d known English personally and that she’d been a
                  member of Gerald Gardner’s coven at Bricket Wood,
                  Hertfordshire, in the early 1960s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55">55</a></sup>
                  Other members of this infamous coven included Doreen Valiente,
                  Lois Bourne, Patricia Crowther, and Eleanor Bone, who became
                  semi-public figures associated with Gardner’s popularising of
                  Wiccan witchcraft. Gardner, whose family traded hardwood
                  sourced throughout the British Empire, claimed to have been
                  initiated into an ancient witch cult in the New Forest, in
                  1939. Their sacred text “Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical” became the
                  basis for his Wiccan <em>Book of Shadows</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56">56</a></sup>
                  English, Burland explained, also belonged to an old coven in
                  Norfolk that met in each other’s houses to dance and raise
                  power before consuming cakes and wine to “ground” themselves.

                  Published in 1998, the autobiography of Lois Bourne of the
                  Bricket Wood coven, <em>Dancing with Witches</em>, refers to
                  Monica English as “Margo”, “the aristocratic witch”. English,
                  allegedly “exuded a strong sexual attraction” and when she
                  danced skyclad (i.e. naked) with the coven her wild vocal
                  calls summoned the owls from miles around.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57">57</a></sup>
                  Strange shapes and shadows would appear in the circle in
                  response to her calls. Bourne claims that English admitted she
                  had joined Bricket Wood because of her concern that Gardner’s
                  publicity would expose the old craft she engaged with in
                  Norfolk. Bourne had visited English at her old manor house in
                  Gayton, Norfolk—at the back of the house, she describes
                  stables and kennels for a pack of hounds—and would eventually
                  join her coven. The historian Ronald Hutton’s account of
                  events at the end of the 1950s in
                  <em>The Triumph of the Moon</em> appears to affirm Bourne’s
                  story:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    At the end of the decade [the Bricket Wood coven] was joined
                    by a wealthy woman who claimed to be a member of a
                    hereditary coven in East Anglia … All that she told it of
                    her own group’s practices was that they were very different,
                    often consisting of sitting in a circle, clad in robes,
                    holding hands and concentrating upon what was to be
                    done.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58">58</a></sup>

                  Howard’s article goes on to note that in a 1960s catalogue of
                  East Anglian artists—Donald Newby’s
                  <em>Guide to Norfolk Art</em>—English is characterised as:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    a painter of two worlds. One of these was a world of myth
                    and legend peopled with the gods, warriors and ghosts of the
                    past, and springs from her study of anthropology, folklore
                    and primitive religions. The other world is the rural
                    reality of landscape and animals, particularly horses, whose
                    beauty and pride of movement fascinates her.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59">59</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  English, according to this catalogue, was self-trained and had
                  mounted seventeen exhibitions, including three at London art
                  galleries. Further exhibitions were planned for galleries in
                  Norwich. She had also appeared on television discussing her
                  artwork and it had been reviewed in provincial and national
                  newspapers and magazines. The catalogue states that she had
                  her own gallery at home, which was open to the public. There
                  is no mention of her participation in witchcraft.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60">60</a></sup>
                  Ironically, it is her artwork that today is occluded.

                  Monica English may have been a charismatic artistic figure in
                  the vicinity of King’s Lynn. If she had ambitions to exhibit
                  beyond the region, Metzger’s previous
                  <em>Sculpture Exhibition at Thirty Queens</em>, including his
                  intense, learned review published in the
                  <em>Lynn News and Advertiser</em>, would have made him an
                  interesting contact. However, based on Metzger’s own training
                  and interest in painting, it is difficult to understand the
                  appeal of English’s paintings. Of course, we have no way of
                  knowing whether Metzger was aware of English’s East Anglian
                  coven. If he had known, it is possible it would have appealed
                  to his own interest in antiquarianism, power, and the
                  esoteric: witchcraft as a model of a counterculture proposes
                  alternative systems of knowledge, often rooted in the desire
                  to positively manifest futures. Or perhaps—we can only
                  speculate—he was returning a favour to English, “the sensitive
                  middle-class woman” who changed his fortunes in 1956?

                  remained open until 10 August (<a href="#jpwatts-fig34">Fig. 34</a>). For this exhibition, Metzger assembled an antiquarian
                  catalogue of thirty-six objects loaned by regional churches,
                  institutes, museums, and private companies that had been
                  damaged, removed, or displaced in the period between the

                  Although there is no known photographic documentation of this
                  exhibition, we do know something of the objects’ and Metzger’s
                  sources because the accompanying four-page gatefold catalogue
                  survives (there is no formal King’s Lynn Festival archive;
                  sourced by Mathieu Copeland, the original is reproduced in
                  <em>Gustav Metzger: Writings 1953–2016)</em> (<a href="#jpwatts-fig35">Fig. 35</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61">61</a></sup>
                  Dating mostly from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, with
                  several objects of the late medieval era, there is a clear
                  pretence to historiographical representativeness, including a
                  range of media—from architectural fragment to statue to
                  glass—that address divergent attitudes of idol breakers,
                  preservationists, and later reformers alike.

                  “Much Church Art was destroyed,” Metzger’s elliptic
                  introduction begins, “in the period between the Reformation
                  and the end of the Commonwealth.” Citing Norwich’s Lord Bishop
                  Hall in Christopher Woodforde’s
                  <em>The Norwich School of Glass-Painting in the Fifteenth
                    Century</em>
                  (1950), the reader learns of his “painfully vivid” account of
                  events at Norwich in May 1644: “‘Lord! what work was here!
                  what clattering of glasses! what beating down of walls! what
                  tearing up of monuments!’” Metzger associates Bishop Hall’s
                  account with object number 21 in the catalogue, “broken from
                  its figure by iconoclasts”: “Head, probably representing
                  Christ. Stone; 14 3/4” high. Carving found in a garden at
                  Spalding".<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn62" id="fnref62">62</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jumping to the nineteenth century, Metzger notes how attitudes
                  towards the plain Protestant interiors and glass of the
                  previous two hundred years had shifted sufficiently so that
                  “Religious works of art were bought, often from the continent,
                  and placed in churches to enrich their appearance. An
                  interesting example of this development can be seen in Wisbech
                  St. Mary Church.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn63" id="fnref63">63</a></sup>
                  Objects number&nbsp;3 and 4&nbsp;in the catalogue illustrate this
                  repopulation: “St Nicholas. About 1500; Wood; traces of
                  original colour. 40” high" and “Kneeling Bishop. About
                  1500; Wood, painted. 32 1/2” high". “This figure and No.
                  3,” the entry continues, “were bought at Christie’s and placed
                  in the Church during this century.”

                  Objects linked to the Reformation and the dissolution of the
                  monasteries were sourced by Metzger from the great abbeys of
                  the eastern region. A 25 1/2 inch long stone “Cover of Heart
                  Burial”, a loan of Wisbech Museum and Literary Institute, was
                  the work of a mason from Crowland Abbey, legendary residence
                  of Hereward the Wake, leader of the local resistance to the
                  Norman Conquest, later fortified and garrisoned by Royalists
                  but besieged and destroyed by Protestant forces. Objects
                  number&nbsp;20 and&nbsp;22 came from the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds, once
                  among the richest Benedictine monasteries in England: “Stained
                  Glass Window … constructed of fragments … includes
                  representations of Edmund as the Boy King and Martyr; one of
                  the Magi (wearing turban…); St. Thomas à Becket (…with aureole
                  and pierced by a sword) and other ecclesiastical and militant
                  figures”. Accompanying it was “The Angel of St Matthew. Stone.
                  29 1/2” high. Possible one of the four symbols of the
                  Evangelists which formed part of a doorway at the Abbey of St.
                  Edmund about 1130–40."

                  The use of the crypt at 17 Queen Street for display must have
                  been an appealing opportunity. An architectural palimpsest,
                  the earliest history of Clifton House is still not entirely
                  agreed upon, but it is, as Pevsner put it, “the most
                  remarkable catalogue of various building periods from the
                  Middle Ages onwards”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn64" id="fnref64">64</a></sup>
                  The external view from the street is the result of
                  rationalisation in 1708; inside, in the nineteenth century,
                  Elizabethan panelling from two rooms was shipped to North
                  America following minor modernisation; in the seventeenth
                  century, major modernisation, thought to be inspired by the
                  mercantile palazzi of Italy, was carried out by Lynn architect
                  Henry Bell; earlier still, in the sixteenth century, drastic
                  reconfigurations occurred, including the addition of a
                  warehouse and a five-storey watchtower. The crypt, however, is
                  the oldest part of the building. Constructed from large,
                  yellowish-pink brick thought to be imported from Holland, it
                  would have opened directly to receive and distribute goods
                  onto the River Ouse before silting redirected its course

                  Throughout its history, Clifton House has been a private
                  residence, aside from a thirty-year period, beginning in 1951,
                  when it was owned by King’s Lynn Town Council and served as
                  the offices of the borough architect, surveyor, and engineer.
                  An opportunity, no doubt, to communicate more widely the
                  crypt’s historic interest, it was the council that granted
                  Metzger access. Accompanying Metzger’s notes in the exhibition
                  catalogue is the speculative text of the borough engineer H.G.
                  Ridler M.I.MUN.E. (Institution of Municipal Engineers), acting
                  as a coda of sorts, who supposes the undercroft’s central
                  piers and brick vaulting in the perpendicular or late Gothic
                  style date it to the fourteenth century. If latterly it had
                  been used as a wine cellar by residents, Ridler admits “the
                  origin and purpose of the building appear not to have been
                  established”. Its purposes could have been religious or
                  secular. Shortly after Metzger’s exhibition, in 1960,
                  installation of council services in the crypt revealed even
                  earlier features. It’s now understood that the mouldings on
                  the central piers carrying the vault date to around 1350.
                  There is evidence, in the south wall, of an earlier
                  thirteenth-century doorway. It seems almost certain that
                  Clifton House was once two medieval tenements thrown together
                  at some later date, probably the late sixteenth century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn66" id="fnref66">66</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Metzger’s exhibition was activated by this extraordinarily
                  compacted historic site. It was, after all, predominantly
                  medieval forms of worship that the iconoclasts faced up to in
                  their revolutionary purging of affective and imaginative
                  splendour.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn67" id="fnref67">67</a></sup>
                  The intense zeal of clattering, beating, and tearing
                  registered by the collection of
                  <em>Treasures from East Anglian Churches</em> must have been
                  in powerful tension with Clifton House’s sedimentary accretion
                  of the past. To describe these objects from East Anglian
                  churches as “treasure”—a wealth of riches stored or
                  accumulated—implies a positive value. Yet, Metzger ultimately
                  resists forming a position on one side or the other of a
                  simplified historic divide between Catholicism and
                  Protestantism. While the unfortunate circumstances of Bishop
                  Hall—a victim of Parliament, confined to the Tower of London,
                  accused of Popish sympathies by Puritan parties, evicted from
                  his palace—elicits sympathy, Metzger’s historiographical
                  approach broadens out the context.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn68" id="fnref68">68</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The great scholar of English iconoclasm Margaret Aston writes
                  that broken idols are always admonitory, but were those in
                  <em>Treasures from East Anglian Churches</em> lamentable
                  losses of pre-defiled, banished objects, or rather lasting
                  witnesses to revolutionary image reform? And while Metzger
                  does refer to the collected objects as “church Art”, the
                  ambiguity of the show’s framing arguably raises questions
                  around the status of art and non-art, and the commonly held
                  assumption that iconoclastic barbarity “severely retarded the
                  development of visual arts in England”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn69" id="fnref69">69</a></sup>
                  Of course, what distinguishes
                  <em>Treasures from East Anglian Churches</em> from, for
                  example, the gallery of broken sculpture in the west end of St
                  Cuthbert’s, Wells, is that it is an artist-curated exhibition.
                  Today, we understand it in relation to Metzger’s own artistic
                  and political concerns.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Its ambiguity also made
                  <em>Treasures from East Anglian Churches</em> a subversive
                  exhibition cloaked in antiquarianism in a town that had strong
                  historical royalist sympathies. Lynn had changed its name from
                  Bishop’s Lynn to King’s Lynn in 1537 as a demonstration of
                  allegiance to Henry VIII and the crown. In 1957, the Festival
                  took place—as it did for many years—under the patronage of
                  Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. Every year for many years,
                  Agnew &amp; Sons, Old Master dealers to the aristocracy,
                  mounted a picture exhibition at the Fermoy Gallery, namesake
                  of Baroness Fermoy. Only three years earlier, in 1954, the
                  King’s Lynn Charter Pageant 1204–1954—of which the borough
                  engineer Ridler himself was on the executive committee—had
                  commemorated the town’s resistance to Cromwell and the
                  Roundheads (<a href="#jpwatts-fig36">Fig. 36</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn70" id="fnref70">70</a></sup>
                  Royalist feeling loomed large.

                  The purging of imagery from worship that took place during the
                  Reformation was, as David Brett has written, “both an index
                  and an ancillary cause of a dramatic shift in the location of
                  authority”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn71" id="fnref71">71</a></sup>
                  Reformation iconoclasm was an ordinance towards the expansion
                  of secular power out of the hands of bishops appointed by the
                  Pope. Secularisation of the imagination preceded the
                  secularisation of society. A revolution of the senses. The
                  destruction of images—as Bishop Hall’s account tells us—was an
                  essential, public, and immediately understood element in wider
                  societal and political reconstruction. Many witnessed—seeing
                  and hearing—large numbers of people participating in
                  demonstrative spectacles of image-breaking.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn72" id="fnref72">72</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As Metzger’s first public engagement with destruction as a
                  theme, which coincided with his gathering campaign for the
                  preservation of the North End of King’s Lynn, discussed later,
                  it is fascinating how it informs his later work. In the first
                  manifesto, “Manifesto SDA Self Destructive Art” of November
                  1959—before the prefix “Auto-” was applied—Metzger urges that
                  “Sda” “is primarily a form of public art for technological
                  societys [<em>sic</em>]”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn73" id="fnref73">73</a></sup>
                  In the second manifesto of March 1960, he states that
                  “auto-destructive art re-enacts the obsession with
                  destruction, / the pummelling to which individuals and masses
                  are subjected”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn74" id="fnref74">74</a></sup>
                  He continues by asserting that it “mirrors the compulsive
                  perfectionism of arms / manufacture—polishing to destruction
                  point”. Auto-destructive art, then, assimilating and mirroring
                  the techniques and materials of advanced technologies,
                  orchestrates an attack on the idols of Metzger’s time. Willing
                  to reproduce their negative affect to change attitudes, it
                  would affect a revolution of the senses comparable to that of
                  the seventeenth century.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Auto-destructive art is expressly not concerned with ruins of
                  a romantic kind associated with the picturesque. In his 1962
                  article for <em>ARK</em>, Metzger asserts that
                  “Auto-destructive art is a radical irrevocable change of
                  image”. It is a sort of cathartic conductor:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Technically elaborate and costly public works of
                    auto-destructive art can have a deeply insidious and
                    cumulative effect on many people—opening feelings, building
                    up tensions, releasing ideas, arousing controversy. This can
                    lead to a more realistic attitude to the productions of
                    (auto-destructive) war materials and to other biologically
                    damaging social activities. By providing a socially
                    sanctioned outlet for destructive ideas and impulses,
                    auto-destructive art can become a valuable instrument of
                    mass psychotherapy in societies where the suppression of
                    aggressive drives is a major factor in the collapse of
                    social balance.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn75" id="fnref75">75</a></sup>

                  In September 1966, the programme of the Destruction in Art
                  Symposium (DIAS) would centre destruction in the course of
                  political and religious protest and agitation as well as art
                  or icon attack as demonstrative terrorism. To deny
                  auto-destructive art’s picturesque ruin value is to insist on
                  its power to transform society, rather than to merely be a
                  resting place for the eye.

                  Our intention to exactly restage
                  <em>Treasures from East Anglian Churches</em> at LOWER.GREEN,
                  Norwich to think through preservation and destruction in a
                  space earmarked for demolition and a contested redevelopment
                  was cooled when we began tracing the objects. Formal museums,
                  including Moyse’s Hall of Bury St Edmunds, Spalding
                  Gentlemen’s Society, and Wisbech and Fenland Museum, accounted
                  for six objects—wood sculpture, stone carving, and glass—which
                  could not be traced, based on descriptions or would not be
                  traced due to lack of resources. While the fourteenth-century
                  Effigy of a Knight, of wood, painted in stone colour, lent by
                  Banham Church, Norfolk, remains in place; two years before our
                  enquiries it had been locked into its bed with reinforced iron
                  clips (<a href="#jpwatts-fig37">Figs. 37</a> and
                  <a href="#jpwatts-fig38">38</a>). If this had not been case,
                  Canon Steven Wright told us, “Sir Bardolf”, as it is
                  affectionately known in the parish, would have been loaned.
                  Canon Wright had no knowledge of its 1957 trip to King’s Lynn.

                  Glass was loaned to Metzger by individual churches, Stratton
                  Strawless, Norfolk and Baningham Church, Norfolk (incorrectly
                  listed as Bannington in the original catalogue), and Norwich
                  lead glaziers G. King &amp; Son from a variety of locations

                  <a href="#jpwatts-fig45">45</a>). The family firm of G. King
                  &amp; Son has not existed for some years now, but the son of
                  its co-founder, Michael King, a medieval glass specialist,
                  explained that Metzger’s selection almost certainly would have
                  consisted mostly of glass under restoration in the workshop at
                  that time and would have been returned to the buildings they
                  came from on completion of the work (which sometimes took a
                  number of years). While Michael was unable to identify with
                  certainty all of the pieces based on Metzger’s description, he
                  suspected that some were part of the collection his uncle was
                  assembling in order to make the Erpingham window in Norwich
                  Cathedral, completed in the early 1960s (<a href="#jpwatts-fig46">Fig. 46</a>). While glass was offered by Reverend Christopher Engelsen
                  of Stratton Strawless, the practicalities of employing a
                  glazier to remove the fragments was beyond our means.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn76" id="fnref76">76</a></sup>
                  Likewise, the practicalities of borrowing the nine grotesque
                  corbels Metzger had been loaned from Norwich Cathedral proved
                  impossible (<a href="#jpwatts-fig47">Figs. 47</a>,
                  <a href="#jpwatts-fig48">48</a>,

                  <a href="#jpwatts-fig52">52</a>). However, viewing the
                  objects, the librarian and curator at the cathedral noted that
                  they were not subject to damage at the time of the Reformation
                  as Metzger had supposed.

                  The remaining object loaned to us for our exhibition came from
                  Fen Ditton Church, Cambridge and is listed in the
                  <em>Treasures from East Anglian Churches</em> catalogue as:
                  “Crowned Head. 13th Century: Stone; 7 1/4˝ high. Carving
                  probably of the fabric of the Church—note direction of the
                  moulding above crown”. The Reverend Dr Alun Ford of Fen
                  Ditton, like Canon Wright, had no knowledge of its 1957 loan
                  to Metzger. For years, it had been placed on a table in the
                  aisle after an elderly member of the congregation found it
                  among other fragments at the base of the bell tower (<a href="#jpwatts-fig53">Fig. 53</a>). In January 1643, it is recorded that William Dowsing,
                  famously appointed by the Earl of Manchester as commissioner

                  his extraordinary inventory of destruction, he records how in
                  Fen Ditton: “We beat down two crucifixes, and the 12 Apostles,
                  and many other superstitious pictures”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn77" id="fnref77">77</a></sup>

                  In the late 1950s, all of the objects loaned to
                  <em>Treasures from East Anglian Churches</em> were mostly
                  “loose parts”, untethered from their architecture and site,
                  assembled for exhibition and then returned again to be fixed
                  into place. Tracing the lives of the objects led us to the
                  single remaining “loose part” at Fen Ditton. The loan of
                  Crowned Head to LOWER.GREEN was done so under emergency
                  measures by the Ely diocese in the understanding that it would
                  be safer on display in our exhibition than to remain on the
                  table in the church. Metzger’s exhibit brought together a
                  series of objects in flux since returned to their (mostly)
                  original surroundings; the loan of the corbel to the
                  LOWER.GREEN show demonstrated the last object to be fixed in
                  its site, also enabling the partially restaged exhibition to
                  take place (see <a href="#jpwatts-fig5">Fig. 5</a>). Its loan
                  to the gallery—and the discovery of its earlier inclusion in
                  Metzger’s <em>Treasures from East Anglian Churches</em>—would
                  form the basis for a funding application to the preservation
                  trust for the appropriate fixings to ensure it could be viewed
                  in the church by visitors to come. Such artefacts become
                  heritage objects when given curatorial recognition: an
                  unintended consequence of Metzger’s prioritisation of raw
                  materials “as found”, which became historically significant as
                  material and visual culture when displayed.

                  It is impossible, as Andrew Wilson has noted, to isolate
                  Metzger’s practice as an artist from his engagement in
                  different kinds of political activism.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn78" id="fnref78">78</a></sup>
                  It is the lecture/demonstration form that Metzger’s first, and
                  subsequent, presentation of auto-destructive art took, and it
                  is the written manifesto that communicates his aims through
                  successive re-draftings. Both seek to inform and persuade,
                  with the “manifesto moment” as Mary Ann Caws calls it,
                  positioned between “what has been done and what will be done,
                  between the accomplished and the potential, in a radical and
                  energizing division”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn79" id="fnref79">79</a></sup>
                  Concerned with “nowness” and “newness”, the manifesto is a
                  deliberate manipulation of the public view, a document of
                  ideology, crafted to rouse, convince, and convert. These are
                  ideal forms for Metzger because, as Wilson writes:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Auto-destructive art was conceived […] as an intrinsically
                    public art form, and its polemical purpose aimed at
                    triggering specific responses in the viewer concerning
                    particular issues to do with, for instance, nuclear weapons
                    and nuclear power, pollution and the capitalist system.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn80" id="fnref80">80</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Metzger’s activism in King’s Lynn formed in response to two
                  destructive threats: on the one hand, the King’s Lynn mayor,
                  chamber of trade and borough council’s post-war redevelopment
                  plans and, on the other hand, nuclear technologies of mass
                  destruction. If the latter had emerged in 1956 as a global
                  threat in the Cold War stand-off between East and West,
                  Khrushchev and Eisenhower, the former Metzger recognised it as
                  a stand-off between preservation of characteristic forms of
                  local cultural life and unilateral commercial interests
                  affecting historic towns across the nation. I explore
                  Metzger’s role in a well-documented activist anti-nuclear
                  movement in the region and then his more localised actions in
                  King’s Lynn. These things coincide but, because of the paucity
                  of biographical information, it is impossible to know how they
                  were experienced simultaneously.

                  following Armistice Day, many were repurposed or returned to
                  farmland, but at RAF North Pickenham, three miles east of
                  Swaffham, fifteen miles south of King’s Lynn, construction
                  work began in 1958 to house PGM-17 Thor, the first

                  Metzger was initially in a regional King’s Lynn branch of
                  Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) but, by 1958, his
                  support shifted to the Direct Action Committee (DAC) in their
                  series of non-violent demonstrations at Swaffham and North
                  Pickenham on 6 and 20 December. It was through a Dr Wells in
                  Hunstanton, who organised the original CND group, that Metzger
                  became acquainted with DAC. Together, they informed their CND
                  branch of their intention to occupy nearby bases and appealed
                  for support in local agitation and in the march.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn81" id="fnref81">81</a></sup>

                  the sound recording equipment for the first was not

                  oak-lined country lanes before entering the site to lobby
                  workers and disrupt construction. They return the following
                  morning and are met with mixed responses, including violence
                  from some of the workers. Metzger remembers his horror at the
                  way protestors were treated:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    We waited and it got dark. Dust fell. They came out smeared
                    in concrete. They had been ducked in concrete by the workmen
                    … There was a painter, John Hoyland, who was a teacher at
                    Chelsea and his eye had been damaged. Women were in a
                    desperate state … It was a reliving of Nazi Germany. When
                    you see people treated like that. They could have been
                    ejected but they were manhandled in a disgraceful manner.

                  At the next march on 20 December arrests were made. Attendees
                  were fewer this second time because, according to Christopher
                  Driver in his account in <em>The Disarmers</em>, the police
                  had threatened coach companies with prosecution if they bussed
                  in marchers. A total of forty-five arrests were made; most
                  were refused bail. Thirty-seven protestors spent Christmas in

                  Around this time, Metzger publicly proselytised about the
                  nuclear threat and travelled to attend nationwide marches and
                  meetings. One account of this comes from Pat Arrowsmith
                  herself, whose report on the first lecture/demonstration of
                  auto-destructive art at Temple Gallery for
                  <em>Peace News</em>, 22 July 1960, suggests his proximity to
                  the DAC leadership (<a href="#jpwatts-fig56">Fig. 56</a>).
                  Arrowsmith notes Metzger’s activism as a necessary context for
                  understanding his intentions:

                    campaign against missile manufacture a year ago; and back in

                  By the time Arrowsmith’s article was published, Metzger had
                  left King’s Lynn, relocating to London, where he had attended
                  meetings with dissatisfied DAC and CND allies in the basement
                  of the New Left hangout, Partisan in Soho. Here, Metzger met
                  the American Youth CND Executive Ralph Schoenman. Desperate to
                  start a new anti-nuclear movement of civil disobedience,
                  Schoenman called on&nbsp;Bertrand Russell as the public face of the
                  campaign. Convinced that CND and DAC were no longer effective,
                  Russell agreed to support what would be the Committee of 100
                  (<a href="#jpwatts-fig57">Fig. 57</a>). Both Schoenman and
                  Metzger, at the time, were reading in the Italian Renaissance
                  period, and, according to Driver’s account, “they decided
                  afterwards that the title ‘Committee of 100’ had been a
                  subconscious reminiscence of the Guelphs and their ‘Council of
                  100’.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn86" id="fnref86">86</a></sup>
                  Its first march on 18 February 1961 gathered 20,000 protestors
                  at Trafalgar Square, followed by a further 5,000 who marched
                  on the Ministry of Defence at Whitehall to a sit-in. No
                  arrests were made.

                  On 6 August, Hiroshima Day, the committee arranged to lay a
                  wreath on the Cenotaph at Whitehall and in the afternoon meet
                  at Speaker’s Corner, Marble Arch.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn87" id="fnref87">87</a></sup>
                  After being told not to use a loudhailer, a contravention of
                  park rules, speakers persisted. The following month members of
                  the committee received a court summons to Bow Street
                  Magistrates Court for 12 September 1961. Russell’s sentence of
                  a month for inciting civil disobedience was&nbsp;commuted to a week
                  due to ill health. “I felt,” Russell recalls in his
                  autobiography, undoubtedly speaking of Metzger, “some of the
                  sentences to be quite unduly harsh, but I was outraged only by
                  the words of the magistrate to one of us who happened to be a
                  Jewish refugee from Germany” (<a href="#jpwatts-fig58">Fig. 58</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn88" id="fnref88">88</a></sup>

                  It is a powerful testament to the persistence of activism in
                  Metzger’s practice that his 2016 retrospective at MUSAC, León,
                  should be titled <em>Act or Perish</em> after
                  <em>Act or Perish: A Call to Non-Violent Action</em>
                  co-authored by Earl Russell and Rev. Michael Scott for the
                  Committee of 100 (<a href="#jpwatts-fig59">Fig. 59</a>). Like
                  the best polemics, the latter’s manifesto-like rhetoric was
                  unwavering and direct:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Every day, and at every moment of every day, a trivial
                    accident, a failure to distinguish a meteor from a bomber, a
                    fit of temporary insanity in one single man, may cause a
                    nuclear world war, which, in all likelihood, will put an end
                    to man and to all higher forms of animal life. […] To us,
                    the vast scheme of mass murder which is being
                    hatched—nominally for our protection, but in fact for
                    universal extermination—is a horror and an abomination. […]
                    Our immediate purpose, in so far as it is political, is only
                    to persuade Britain to abandon reliance upon the illusory
                    protection of nuclear weapons […] We appeal, as human beings
                    to human beings: remember your humanity, and forget the
                    rest. If you can do so, the way lies open to a new Paradise;
                    if you cannot, nothing lies before you but universal
                    death.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn89" id="fnref89">89</a></sup>

                <p>
                  In the penultimate chapter of Christopher Driver’s
                  <em>The Disarmers</em>, “Art in a Cold Climate”, he begins,
                  echoing Herbert Read, by arguing that “nothing signifies the
                  horizontal spread and vertical penetration” of
                  bomb-consciousness in British society than the response to it
                  of creative artists. And yet, paradoxically, he writes, “the
                  significance of this response lies as much in eloquent
                  silences and omissions as in direct utterances”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn90" id="fnref90">90</a></sup>
                  While the leading writers and artists aligned with Schoenman
                  and the Committee of 100 were highly effective pamphleteers,
                  in their professional work, they tended to approach the
                  problems of nuclear weapons and their use only tangentially:
                  “One senses a feeling not only of political helplessness
                  before the fact of nuclear weapons but of imaginative
                  helplessness also.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn91" id="fnref91">91</a></sup>
                  The nuclear sublime—not unlike the Holocaust in Germany—is so
                  obscene, so incomprehensibly destructive that, perhaps, the
                  creative imagination cannot assimilate it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While Driver, writing retrospectively, goes on to acknowledge
                  a shift in attitudes to representing the bomb a decade later,
                  it is instructive to return to Arrowsmith’s
                  <em>Peace News</em> article on Metzger’s first
                  lecture/demonstration of auto-destructive art.
                  Auto-destructive art would, in a symbolic way, she writes,
                  “demonstrate the current state of society: a society whose
                  basic ingredients are such that it seems all too likely to end
                  up by destroying itself”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn92" id="fnref92">92</a></sup>
                  And yet, as she watches the nylon disintegrate, she cannot
                  deny the beauty of the dynamic proliferation of images.
                  Sensing a paradox between destruction and creation, Arrowsmith
                  suggests that “Metzger is not logical: a self-destroying
                  society should not look beautiful at this stage.” “But,” she
                  continues, “nor is he a nihilist—and this is important. The
                  value of his constructive ideas and positive approach outweigh
                  the failure of logic. Society is all too full today of
                  apathetic and despairing people whose only values are
                  negative.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn93" id="fnref93">93</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Arrowsmith’s sensitive and intelligent analysis is willing to
                  move beyond critical orthodoxy to admit a complexity at the
                  very core of Metzger’s practice. Indeed, in his third
                  manifesto of 1961, “Auto-Creative Art”, which he defines as
                  “an art of change, growth, movement”, enters his artistic
                  idiom.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn94" id="fnref94">94</a></sup>
                  The tension between destruction and creation is by now a
                  central aspect of Metzger’s practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Metzger’s intense activism around the bomb coincided with his
                  North End Protest (1957) out of which formed the North End
                  Society (1958) to protest the King’s Lynn mayor, chamber of
                  trade and borough council’s post-war redevelopment scheme
                  affecting historic fishing quarters. The lessons of persuasive
                  rhetoric crafted to rouse, convince, and convert, strategies
                  of distribution and publicity, and recruitment are
                  instrumental in Metzger’s letter to the editor of
                  <em>Lynn News and Advertiser</em> of 20 December 1957,
                  responding to a speech delivered by the mayor at the town’s
                  chamber of commerce addressing his prior criticisms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1957, Metzger was living in St Nicholas House next to St
                  Nicholas, a chapel of ease founded in 1146 to serve new
                  fishermen’s quarters forming around North Street and Pilot
                  Street—the North End (<a href="#jpwatts-fig60">Fig. 60</a>).
                  Following earlier slum clearances in the 1930s, it had come to
                  Metzger’s attention that the few remaining cottages would be
                  lost to a road on a proposed redevelopment plan. “I was going
                  home and I saw a poster saying that there was a hearing on the
                  15 August into the future of the North End,” Metzger
                  recalls.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn95" id="fnref95">95</a></sup>
                  He continues:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    I saw this and I thought I had better look into this … What
                    is going to happen? I went to the town hall and looked at
                    the programme and it horrified me … I said this is totally
                    unacceptable. If no one else is going to do anything I
                    thought I have to do something immediately.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn96" id="fnref96">96</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Characterising the road as an “autobahn”, it would, he writes
                  in the <em>Lynn News</em> <em>and Advertiser</em> letter,
                  encircle St Nicholas: “Probably the greatest work of
                  architecture in Lynn”, which would be “stripped of its deepest
                  spiritual aesthetic meaning”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn97" id="fnref97">97</a></sup>

                  The <em>Lynn News and Advertiser</em> said they would
                  photograph Metzger and the following issue of the newspaper
                  featured him on the front page with the headline: “Gustav
                  Metzger Protest Against Redevelopment of North End” (see
                  <a href="#jpwatts-fig10">Fig. 10</a>). “I was flabbergasted,”
                  Metzger recalls:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    That was the start. It never stopped. It went on and on and
                    on. People would then talk to me on the Tuesday Market
                    stall. This became a little subversive focus. Within a few
                    months I initiated a North End society. One man, a
                    patriarch, whose house we would meet—in his seventies, white
                    face or beard—a fisherman, old but powerful, he was
                    agitating behind the scenes. We had a university-trained
                    woman who became secretary. We had a programme, a
                    constitution.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn98" id="fnref98">98</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  As Metzger understood it, the rich people sitting in the town
                  hall wanted to get rid of a lower, primitive way of life. This
                  was not, as he put it, just about the economy or maintaining
                  generational wealth, but an attack on another level of life.
                  Interestingly, Metzger begins his letter stating that it is
                  “the first official response to the national protest against
                  subtopia next to St Nicholas’ Chapel which I am
                  organizing”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn99" id="fnref99">99</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In July 1955, “Subtopia” was a neologism coined by the
                  architectural critic Ian Nairn in the
                  <em>Architectural Review’s</em> “Outrage” issue. Having
                  travelled the breadth of England by car, Nairn encountered
                  such undifferentiated town planning that “the end of
                  Southampton looks like the beginning of Carlisle and the parts
                  in between look like the end of Carlisle or the beginning of
                  Southampton”. “Subtopia” named this characterless landscape,
                  where singularity of place had been scrubbed out and, with it,
                  characteristic English consciousness—a “mass psychosis rooted
                  in the fantastic acceptance of mediocrity”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn100" id="fnref100">100</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The success of the “Outrage” issue led the
                  <em>Architectural Review</em> to establish a “Counter-Attack
                  Bureau” that functioned as a “service to monitor and guide the
                  good visual character of England” for architects, planners,
                  and citizens. A monthly “Counter-Attack” column in the journal
                  monitored specific cases submitted by readers. In the spirit
                  of attack, Metzger signs off his <em>Lynn News</em>
                  <em>and Advertiser</em> letter to the editor by stating that:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    it has been a long time since Lynn Borough Council has been
                    faced with national opposition, but it happens to be in the
                    national interest to maintain the old town of Lynn as an
                    oasis, a kind of architectural lung, in an increasingly
                    industrialized, spoilt England.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn101" id="fnref101">101</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Indeed, in the North End Society’s document of stated aims,
                  published the following year in February 1958, support was
                  confirmed by the <em>Architectural Review</em>’s
                  “Counter-Attack: Against Subtopia Unit [<em>sic</em>]”,
                  established by popular demand to combat its spread, the
                  Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, and the
                  Norfolk branch of the Campaign for the Protection of Rural
                  England. The story went to the regional
                  <em>Eastern Daily Press</em>, which probably syndicated it to
                  the national press. Taking aim at the council’s appointment of
                  Dr Thomas Sharp, a famous town planner who been consulted on
                  numerous post-war redevelopments, including in Durham (1945),
                  Exeter (1946), Chester (1945), Merseyside (1945),
                  Middlesborough (1946), and Worcester (1946), the society’s
                  stated objectives were to protect North Street and Pilot
                  Street from wholesale demolition by Lynn council and to work
                  for the repair and improvement of property in these streets

                  Should demolition be required to take place, the statement
                  reads, rebuilding should be from a scheme prepared by an
                  eminent architect, bearing in mind the historic character of
                  the area, giving preference to houses for remaining fishermen
                  and their families.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn103" id="fnref103">103</a></sup>

                  Metzger, speaking in the late 1990s, recalled that he had gone
                  as far as purchasing a house in North End—something simple,
                  one up one down—for £10 from a dealer friend that he would
                  squat in until the bitter end. Could this have been 26 Pilot
                  Street (see <a href="#jpwatts-fig9">Fig. 9</a>)? Although the
                  plans drawn up by Sharp were not instigated in town, others
                  were, and Metzger felt they had lost. They saved some houses
                  and modified the road. Ultimately, this was a factor that
                  motivated his departure: “I felt, look if King’s Lynn is a
                  town that even thinks of that, even if there is a struggle and
                  we lose, then why stay?”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn104" id="fnref104">104</a></sup>
                  The actions of the North End Society motivated the creation of
                  King’s Lynn Preservation Trust. In 1978, the trust restored 26
                  Pilot Street, alongside five other properties. It is possible
                  that without Metzger’s and the North End Society’s
                  intervention an autobahn would now span the medieval town.
                </p>
                <h1 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h1>
                <p>
                  Asked by Hans Ulrich Obrist in 2008 where his oeuvre would
                  begin, Metzger periodised the early work according to that
                  made under Bomberg, followed by “the King’s Lynn years”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn105" id="fnref105">105</a></sup>
                  Undoubtedly, it was a significant period in the artist’s
                  development: to have conserved works on paper from this
                  time—and control&nbsp;their release in exhibitions later in his
                  life—appears to be somewhat of a paradox given his later
                  work’s preoccupation with the trauma of destruction. While
                  Metzger’s life and later auto-destructive art, strikes, and
                  ecological activism have received scholarly attention in
                  retrospectives and monographs, little has been written of this
                  remarkable time in King’s Lynn. Metzger’s “return” to this
                  troubling early period coincided with Lynda Morris’ invitation
                  in 2005.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Aside from EASTinternational, the extent of Metzger’s
                  curatorial work is often understood as being limited to the
                  important Destruction in Art Symposium of 1966. However, as
                  this article has argued, Metzger actively programmed Thirty
                  Queens alongside the re-emergence of his own art practice. In
                  fact, it was in the catalogue of
                  <em>Treasures from East Anglian Churches</em>, in his writing
                  and curatorial practice—rather than his later paintings on
                  steel—that Metzger first engages with the topic of
                  destruction. Re-examining Metzger’s time in King’s Lynn, I
                  have sought to extend the characterisation of his work to
                  include that of artist-dealer, artist-curator, and
                  artist-activist and to see this town as central to his
                  conceptions of art, politics, and life."

                        Metzger admired the Smithsons’ school at Hunstanton, ten
                        miles from King’s Lynn, completed in 1954, an exemplary
                        for Banham of new brutalism in architecture. Three years
                        later, in 1957, the Smithsons would write that
                        “Brutalism tries to face up to a mass-produced society,
                        and drag a rough poetry out of the confused and powerful
                        forces which are at work.” See Alison and Peter
                        Smithson, “The New Brutalism”,
                        <em>Architectural Design 27</em> (April 1957), 113.

                        but before a separate statue of the Virgin, and images
                        of Sts Margaret, Anne, Nicholas, John the Baptist,
                        Thomas Becket, Christopher, Erasmus, James the Great,
                        Katherine, Petronella, Sythe, and Michael the

                  Zarina Bhimji’s work debuted in London in the 1980s, during a
                  period that witnessed important revisionist critiques from the
                  feminist and Black British art movements. Her early photo-text
                  installations, primarily created while&nbsp;she was a student at
                  Goldsmiths’ College, address issues surrounding diaspora, the
                  body, and the inhumanity of Britain’s immigration process.
                  While these understudied works are most often framed in
                  relation to postmodernist identity politics, Bhimji’s work
                  avoids overtly political signifiers, instead privileging
                  symbolically charged indices and abstract visual tableaux. As
                  the artist states, “The language I use is related to
                  vulnerability and this is not a culturally specific emotion”.
                  Working toward a more holistic understanding of Bhimji’s art
                  and its context, this article places it in dialogue with that
                  of Mary Kelly, who taught at Goldsmiths throughout the 1980s
                  and whose own production in London bridged the artistic and
                  discursive boundaries that divided the art of&nbsp;the time. In so
                  doing, it positions Bhimji in relation to both surrealist and
                  second-wave feminist artists through her interest in affect,
                  memory, and the symbolic representation of enigmatic childhood
                  and domestic objects as expressions of subjectivity and the
                  unconscious. As such, it demonstrates that postcolonial
                  artists&nbsp;such as Bhimji are central, not peripheral, to the
                  development of British contemporary art history.

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  In 1993, the art critic Jyll Bradley wrote a profile in
                  <em>Women’s Art Magazine</em> on the Ugandan-Asian artist
                  Zarina Bhimji, in which she reviewed the artist’s solo
                  exhibition at the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham and assessed
                  Bhimji’s nascent practice.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  Bradley recalls her first encounter with the artist’s work
                  about&nbsp;seven years prior, when she saw her degree show at
                  Goldsmiths' College, London. Bhimji had prepared a series of
                  color-stained photographs paired with short textual phrases,
                  each encased in black frames. Reading “SILENCE IS STARVATION”
                  or “SILENCE ABOUT TO BREAK”, these feature quotations&nbsp;from
                  third-wave feminist texts by such writers as Cherríe Moraga,
                  Audre Lorde, bell hooks, and Hazel Carby.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  Bhimji’s images, however, are wholly incommensurate with the
                  declarative tone of her textual panels: they depict enigmatic
                  tableaux of mundane domestic objects, photographed at
                  floor-level or from unusual viewpoints and focusing on the
                  interplay of light and texture, or the manipulation of scale.
                  Titled
                  <em>In Response to the F-Stops Exhibition (For the White
                    Feminist)</em>, the series, according to Bradley, “seemed to address the
                  unacknowledged absence of black women in white feminist
                  discourses which encouraged women to re-see, re-read and
                  re-invent lives and histories. Bhimji was using the ‘new’
                  language of sight to discuss that which was silenced”. Yet,
                  the installation, she continues, “addressed this in subtle
                  ways—the upsetting of a bowl, a foot penetrating the frame of
                  a tray. Silences were small and significant, large and
                  echoing” (<a href="#akyoung-fig1">Figs. 1</a>&nbsp;and

                  Archival records on Bhimji’s early photo-text practice are
                  scant;&nbsp;Bradley’s review contains one of the only published
                  mentions of her degree show, about which many questions
                  remain.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  In this short piece, the critic articulates a paradox&nbsp;that has
                  continued to&nbsp;mark the reception of and scholarship on Bhimji’s
                  practice. While her work is understood to be concerned with
                  issues such as migration and diaspora, the body, memory and
                  trauma, and the violence of humanitarian crises, her images
                  are also perceived as iconographically illegible,
                  intentionally emptied of political or biographical signifiers.
                  This apparent illegibility is amplified by the artist’s
                  persistent rejection of critical interpretations that read her
                  images only in relation to her specific cultural
                  background.&nbsp;Viewers must search for meaning, instead, in
                  tender photographs of childhood objects or abandoned edifices;
                  in ephemeral materials such as spices, flowers, and burnt
                  cloth; in the play of light and texture; in personal keepsakes
                  and lines of poetry&nbsp;(<a href="#akyoung-fig3">Fig. 3</a>). Such
                  vignettes function as indices to the feelings of loss,
                  betrayal, and melancholy that accompany the mass migrations
                  and acts of violence of which her work softly speaks. Critics
                  continue to describe her work as opaque, enigmatic, and
                  purposefully evasive. This much is certainly true. Yet I would
                  venture that this perception has as much to do with factors
                  external to Bhimji’s practice—such as the rise of artistic
                  postmodernism and mounting debates about race, identity, and
                  inclusivity in the&nbsp;British art world in the 1980s—as it does
                  with the art itself. We assume that we are perceiving
                  something absent or erased, yet too often ignore the visual
                  intelligence of what is there, in plain sight before us.

                  Toward the advancement of scholarship on this earliest stage
                  in Bhimji’s career, this article focuses on the artist’s
                  photo-text work of the 1980s, and asks what new connections
                  and frameworks may arise when we consider Bhimji’s work in
                  dialogue with a wider range of art made in and around the
                  London scene of the 1980s and 1990s. The text unfolds in three
                  sections: the first provides an overview of the&nbsp;institutional
                  forces that limited the reception&nbsp;of work by Black British
                  artists during these years; the second&nbsp;reconsiders Bhimji’s
                  art in relation to surrealist aesthetics and visualizations of
                  memory and the unconscious, by way of the work of her tutor at
                  Goldsmiths, the artist Mary Kelly; and the third addresses her
                  work’s relationship to poetry as an analogous creative form.
                  In approaching Bhimji’s work as part of a more complex
                  art-historical lineage than is often assumed, I intend to
                  trouble the stringency of art history’s classificatory
                  structures, as well as to demonstrate that post-colonial or
                  Global South artists such as Bhimji are central, not
                  peripheral, to the development of British contemporary art.

                  This strategy is motivated by the work of critics such as Jean
                  Fisher and Kobena Mercer, who have long&nbsp;compelled art
                  historians and critics to move beyond writing that
                  overemphasizes sociological frameworks while neglecting the
                  art object itself. As Mercer ventured in his essay
                  “Iconography After Identity”, which addresses the state of
                  critical writing on Black British artists of the 1980s, “there
                  is a strong tendency in much of this discourse to shuttle
                  between two extremes, between a sort of low-grade
                  celebrationism of multicultural murmuring and a highly
                  charged, explosive and divisive&nbsp;controversy, both of which
                  deflect attention from the work of art itself”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  He later surmises that:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    because so much of the writing concentrates on the artist’s
                    biographical identity or the experience of exclusion in
                    institutional practice, the more interesting problems and
                    questions of interpretation concerning iconography and
                    iconology tend to be continually pushed back and
                    deferred.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  In much of her writing through the 1990s, Jean Fisher astutely
                  acknowledged that:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    to be locked into the frame of ethnicity is also to be
                    locked <em>out</em> of a rigorous philosophical and
                    historical debate that risks crippling the work’s
                    intellectual development, and excluding it from the global
                    circuit of ideas where it rightfully belongs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  I follow Fisher’s imploration to “rethink the ways by which we
                  frame art in order to
                  <em>return to it what is proper to art</em>”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  My aim is not to discount the significance of Bhimji’s
                  position as a diasporic subject, which remains crucial to a
                  holistic understanding of her art. Yet the issue lies with
                  what is often a reductive reception of her works, whereby the
                  search for biographical signification, guided by both the rise
                  of critical postmodernism and the politics of racial
                  representation in 1980s Britain, results in one of two
                  outcomes: either the work is simplified and misread as being
                  merely <em>about</em> South Asia, Uganda, or postcolonial
                  histories in a didactic sense;&nbsp;or it is declared to be
                  inadequate because&nbsp;such references aren’t readily available at
                  the surface. As one writer admitted in a 1988 feature on
                  Bhimji's work, “[o]ne of the criticism[s] Zarina has received
                  is that her work is ‘not powerful enough’, that it is too
                  ‘quiet’, almost bordering on the passive”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  Responding to this critique, Bhimji has stated: “my work is
                  not passive. It deals with complex issues which I like to give
                  time to”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                  By the early 1990s, Bhimji began to strongly resist being
                  categorized or labeled as a “Black artist” or an “Asian
                  artist”, and refused to participate in any more group
                  exhibitions that were premised around the theme of identity.
                  As she told&nbsp;the art historian Zehra Jumabhoy in 2012, “I just
                  don’t find such conversations interesting”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                  Evidence of her refusals and objections are readily found and
                  oft-noted in literature, interviews, and statements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What should we make, then, of the subtle tableaux, fragmented
                  textual phrases, and shifting points of view that characterize
                  Bhimji’s early photo-text installations? What other
                  interpretive methods may be brought to bear on a practice that
                  is intentionally guarded in the face of such critique? One
                  method that is rarely explored is to reverse the terms of the
                  above dismissal, to lean into the “quietness” in her art as a
                  source of insight. In their edited volume,
                  <em>Silence, Feminism, Power: Reflections at the Edges of
                    Sound</em>
                  (2013), Sheena Malhotra and Aimee Carillo Rowe suggest
                  that&nbsp;“silence allows us the space to breathe. It allows us the
                  freedom of not having to exist constantly in relation to what
                  is said”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                  Running counter to the idea that “silence” is symptomatic of
                  oppression and powerlessness—as in Gayatri Spivak’s famous
                  call for the subaltern to “speak”—Malhotra and Rowe
                  problematize our accepted understanding of a power dynamic
                  that favors those with the loudest voice, or the paternalistic
                  notion that voice needs only be ‘given’ to marginalized
                  individuals. They ask, instead, a question that motivates my
                  research and reflections on Bhimji’s art: “What nuances,
                  strategic forms of engagement and ways of navigating or
                  resisting power are made possible through silence?”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>

                  <em>From Two Worlds</em> and the Politics of Representation in
                  1980s Britain
                </h1>
                <p>
                  There is an almost playful sense of indirectness in Bhimji’s
                  statements about her upbringing and past experiences, which
                  echoes the abstract visual language that characterizes much of
                  her work. When asked about her childhood in Uganda, for
                  instance, she has avoided factual anecdotes in favor of
                  sensory invocations, describing images, sounds, and colors
                  drawn directly from memory. In a 1993 interview, she explained
                  that her earliest memories were “textural things which are
                  very small rather than specific … more like, the texture of
                  the wallpaper, or the earth, or my brother being born”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>
                  One year earlier, speaking on BBC radio with the curator Mark
                  Haworth-Booth, she recalled memories of “bees in cardboard
                  boxes, the sound of it… the earth, the mud, the color of the
                  mud”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
                  Such anecdotes are of interest here, not necessarily because
                  of <em>what</em> they tell us but <em>how.</em> Fascinated
                  with such multilayered and subtle modes of expression, Bhimji
                  has recounted the creative ways in which different&nbsp;members of
                  her family “used” the Gujarati language: her father, for
                  instance, incorporated metaphor into his speech, entangling
                  multiple meanings and associations, never satisfied with
                  simple facts and narratives. “That’s how I think I developed
                  my interest in poetry,” she muses. “Things that he’s told me,
                  I found that I kind of use in my photography”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bhimji was just eleven years old when her family, in 1974,
                  joined the nearly 30,000 refugees who settled in the United
                  Kingdom after Idi Amin’s decree calling for the mass expulsion
                  of Asians from&nbsp;Uganda two years earlier. Raised in Leicester,
                  she came of age in an era of British politics notable for the
                  xenophobic and anti-immigration campaigns of Conservative
                  politicians such as Enoch Powell and Norman Tebbit, a period
                  followed by a decade&nbsp;of austerity and ethno-nationalist
                  nostalgia under Margaret Thatcher. As a teenager, Bhimji
                  became interested in feminist and anti-racist activism, and
                  was naturally drawn to the theatricality of such
                  demonstrations. She visited the Greenham Common Women’s Peace
                  Camp, a non-violent activist community formed in the early
                  1980s to protest the establishment of an American nuclear base
                  in the County of Berkshire, west of London. In their most well
                  documented protest action in 1983, women gathered to link arms
                  around nine miles of barbed-wire fencing. They affixed objects
                  to the fences—baby clothes, bottles, teething rings, family
                  photographs, and stuffed animals—so that these intimate
                  objects would demonstrate the human toll of nuclear
                  catastrophe.&nbsp;Bhimji has recently recalled how the fence
                  resembled a kind of site-specific art: “Looking back, it was
                  this mix of ethical and intellectual reflections that stayed
                  with me throughout my career as an artist”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1983, Bhimji began her studies at Goldsmiths, where she
                  continued to be drawn to the use of distinctive objects, or
                  images thereof, as indirect stand-ins for her personal or
                  emotional experience. Undated photographs from her student
                  portfolio offer hints of her political awakening: in one,
                  captioned “How India won her Freedom”, she layers her Student
                  Union ID card from Goldsmiths over the visa document that
                  allowed her entry to Britain from Uganda. In another, a pair
                  of sandals is thrown haphazardly on the floor. One shoe has
                  landed on a softcover book, which is open to the first page of
                  bell hooks’ essay, “Racism and Feminism: The Issue of
                  Accountability”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>
                  The artist joined a women’s group at Goldsmiths, and read
                  texts by Audre Lorde and Adrienne Rich, all of which informed
                  her desire to fuse the personal and political in her art.

                <p>
                  Bhimji’s debut on the British art scene coincided with several
                  important group exhibitions of work by Black artists:
                  <em>From Two Worlds</em>&nbsp;at London’s Whitechapel Gallery
                  (1986), <em>The Image Employed</em>&nbsp;at Manchester’s
                  Cornerhouse Gallery (1987), and
                  <em>The Essential Black Art</em>&nbsp;at London’s Chisenhale
                  Gallery (1988). Yet, like many artists of her generation, she
                  soon grew uneasy that her participation in such survey shows
                  would encourage the tokenization of her work within the wider
                  British art world. Institutional interest in the work of Black
                  artists, in the late 1980s, was often led by a new Arts
                  Council policy whereby arts organizations could only access
                  all available funding by promoting "diversity".<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>
                  Between 1985 and 1990 alone she participated in nearly fifteen
                  group exhibitions that were themed around varied demarcations
                  of racial or ethnic identity. These included shows that
                  emphasized Asian or Asian-British identity, such as
                  <em>Jagrati</em> at the Greenwich People’s Gallery, London
                  (1986), <em>Darshan</em> at Camerawork Gallery, London (1986),
                  and <em>Fabled Territories</em> at the Leeds City Art Gallery
                  (1990), as well as those themed around Black or Black-British
                  identity,&nbsp;including&nbsp;<em>Mirror Reflecting Darkly</em> at
                  Brixton Art Gallery, London (1985),
                  <em>Black Women Photographers</em> at Camden Arts Centre,
                  London (1987), <em>The Devil’s Feast</em> at Chelsea School of
                  Art, London (1987),&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Dislocation</em> at Kettle’s Yard
                  Art Gallery, Cambridge (1987), among others.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Such exhibitions arrived on the heels of decades of activism
                  waged in protest of the British art world’s pervasive culture
                  of racial exclusionism, yet they&nbsp;were inadequate solutions
                  proposed via bureaucratic channels.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>
                  In 1981, for instance, the Greater London Council implemented
                  a “Race Relations Unit” and “Ethnic Minorities Committee”, the
                  latter appended by a subdivision called the “Black Arts
                  Division” that sponsored exhibitions and provided funding to
                  artists. In the&nbsp;following few years, the Arts Council of&nbsp;Great
                  Britain created new appointments and committees tasked with
                  supporting “Black and Minority Ethnic” artists. This increase
                  in financial support was certainly welcome, yet, as Naseem
                  Khan had predicted&nbsp;half a decade earlier in her prescient 1976
                  report, <em>The Arts Britain Ignores</em>, the “creation of
                  new structures, Ethnic Arts Boards and full time officers” ran
                  the risk of furthering segregation within the art world,
                  establishing “an alternative body—a sort of parallel black
                  Arts Council”, which would “perpetuate the myth that ethnic
                  arts are some special activity for ethnic minorities
                  alone”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  These&nbsp;developments meant that Black artists were increasingly
                  limited in their control over the contexts in which their work
                  was displayed. The checklists for exhibitions bearing titles
                  such as
                  <em>Eastern Views: Works by Young Asian Artists from the
                    Midlands</em>
                  (New Walk Museum, Leicester, 1985) or
                  <em>Double-Vision: An Exhibition of Contemporary Afro-Caribbean
                    Art</em>
                  (Cartwright Hall, Bradford, 1986–87), were guided by artists’
                  backgrounds, rather than a desire for thematic or stylistic
                  cohesion. Viewers, in turn, came to expect such projects to be
                  instructive or educational, as if an exercise in sociology
                  rather than art. As Fisher would later put it, the art
                  criticism that followed “tends not to look at or address the
                  experience of the work but rather, a commodified level of
                  context”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">22</a></sup>
                  The result is palpable in critical responses that range from
                  the naive to the pernicious; in a review of the groundbreaking
                  <em>Into the Open</em> at Sheffield’s Mapping Gallery,
                  Waldemar Januszczak ventures that “all black art is no more
                  worthy of our undivided attention than all white art”, a
                  statement that is perhaps only palatable when understood as a
                  condemnation of the “survey” model in general.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">23</a></sup>
                  As Eddie Chambers notes, overtly racist language can be found
                  in many critical assessments of the era’s most significant
                  exhibitions, where terms such as “loud and angry”, or “choking
                  on its own anger” are deployed “to describe art that had
                  attempted to challenge racism or explore identity and
                  culture”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">24</a></sup>
                  Eventually, as Fisher has remarked, “the perception that an
                  ‘ethnicity marker’ would, on the one hand, lead to limited
                  readings of the work, and on the other, prejudice an artist’s
                  success in a commercial market unreceptive to non-white
                  artists was … a wide-spread anxiety”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">25</a></sup>
                  This claim is evidenced by the refusals&nbsp;of such artists
                  as&nbsp;Anish Kapoor and Shirazeh Houshiary, who primarily work in
                  abstraction and have achieved widespread acclaim since the
                  1980s, to participate in exhibitions such as
                  <em>The Other Story</em>. Bhimji’s own early hesitance is
                  legible in her contribution to the
                  <em>From Two Worlds</em> exhibition catalogue, in which she
                  asserts that “the act of making oneself visible, of exploring
                  identity’s many selves, can be a dangerous one”, and that she
                  “refuses to adopt the constraints of soul destroying
                  stereotypes”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">26</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In fact, the example of <em>From Two Worlds</em> at the
                  Whitechapel Gallery, which constitutes Bhimji’s debut in a
                  major institutional venue, lends some context to these
                  concerns. Themed around the notion of cultural synthesis, the
                  show was organized by then director Nicholas Serota in
                  collaboration with the artists Gavin Jantjes, Sonia Boyce and
                  Veronica Ryan, who acted as selectors. In the catalogue, the
                  organizers write that they “felt that the most valuable
                  exhibition at this moment would be one which sought to reveal
                  the limitation of labels such as “Asian”, “Indian”,
                  “Japanese”, or “Afro-Caribbean” which are often used
                  unthinkingly to describe art of very different moods and
                  ambitions.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">27</a></sup>
                  The show generated mixed reviews, both within and beyond the
                  Black British art scene. James Lampley wrote for the
                  <em>African Concord</em> that: “<em>From Two Worlds</em> …
                  openly invites the kind of labels that its organisers are
                  determined to avoid: the “ethnic” tag generally appended to
                  art emanating from the Third World, or in this instance, art
                  by non-European artists living in Britain.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">28</a></sup>
                  In <em>City Limits: London</em>, Mark Currah suggests that the
                  included work “overcomes the restrictions imposed on it: the
                  category into which it had to fit to merit inclusion”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">29</a></sup>
                  The Artist Keith Piper wrote that
                  <em>From Two Worlds</em> “looked and operated as if it had
                  been formulated within the classic ‘survey’ mould”, echoing
                  the response of Chambers, who declined to participate and
                  later ventured that the show was “arguably, ultimately an
                  exercise in marginalization”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">30</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The discourse surrounding this exhibition reveals much about
                  the forces guiding the interpretation of work by Black artists
                  that diverged from the kinds of sociological or political
                  expressions that critics had by then come to expect. While
                  Bhimji&nbsp;turned away from biographical and culturally specific
                  content in her art of the 1990s, her early photo-text
                  installations provide an interesting opportunity&nbsp;to expand our
                  interpretive toolkit; in many cases, these works
                  <em>do</em> address issues surrounding gender, immigration,
                  and diaspora, but perhaps the more interesting question is
                  <em>how</em>. Fisher, again, offers insightful commentary on
                  art criticism in the age of postmodernist identity politics.
                  She cautions against “a return to some hermetic formalist
                  critique”, clarifying instead: “I am asking how we might
                  effectively understand the processes of art, especially where
                  cross-cultural symbolic orders are employed, without making
                  them a sub-category of, say, anthropology or sociology. Visual
                  art remains a material-based process, functioning on the level
                  of <em>affect</em>, not purely semiotics—i.e., a synaesthetic
                  relation is established between work and viewer which is
                  <em>in excess of visuality</em>. It involves rather enigmatic
                  sensations such as the vibrations of rhythm and spatiality, in
                  a sense of scale and volume, of touch and smell, of lightness,
                  stillness, silence or noise, all of which resonate with the
                  body and its reminiscences and operate on the level of “sense”
                  not “meaning””.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">31</a></sup>
                  For <em>From Two Worlds</em>, Bhimji presented two photo-text
                  installations (both 1986), which were installed across a
                  corner of a gallery. One of these, entitled *What She
                  Herself…Is…Was…Would Like To Be?&nbsp;*is a grouping of eight
                  “stained” amber-colored photographs of clothing paired with
                  elusive fragments of text (<a href="#akyoung-fig4">Fig. 4</a>). This work’s title is a&nbsp;reference to the short phrases that
                  are embossed in a stenciled typeface across the panels. Visual
                  motifs include clothing strewn across the floor, a small
                  painted box with decorative floral patterns, and an
                  embroidered object (<a href="#akyoung-fig5">Fig. 5</a>).

                  No doubt prompted by the overarching theme of
                  <em>From Two Worlds</em> as it relates to expressions of
                  cultural identity, commentators tended to search for perceived
                  signifiers of “Indianness” within Bhimji’s contribution to
                  <em>From Two Worlds</em>, despite there being very few within
                  the images (<a href="#akyoung-fig6">Fig. 6</a>). Nick Axarlis,
                  for instance, suggested that the artist “uses photography and
                  text to investigate the lives of Asian women”, a statement
                  that seems slightly at odds with the highly personal nature of
                  Bhimji’s art;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">32</a></sup>
                  Deanna Petherbridge misidentified an object in one photograph
                  as a “skull cap” worn by Muslims during daily prayers.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">33</a></sup>
                  Yet relevant iconography was subtly present. In addition to
                  the titular stenciled phrase, Bhimji included handwritten
                  texts, photographed and re-printed for the installation, which
                  seemed to narrate her personal negotiation of cultural
                  identity: “The past is a dream”, reads the leftmost panel, in
                  cursive handwriting. “Flying my flag of identity, I prowl, in
                  search of the chanting, incognito still, alone, but aware,
                  visible. In peach shalwar kamiz with red geometric pattern …
                  Black Boots”. A nearby photograph depicted a pair of trousers,
                  a blouse, and a pair of black Doc Martens. For some, the shoes
                  may have recalled Mona Hatoum’s 1985
                  <em>Roadworks</em> performance in Brixton, wherein the
                  British-Palestinian artist walked barefoot, with Doc Martens—a
                  symbol of British ethno-nationalism, “usually worn by both
                  police and skinheads”—laced around her ankles like prisoner’s
                  shackles (<a href="#akyoung-fig7">Fig. 7</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">34</a></sup>
                  As such, in Bhimji’s piece, text and image work together to
                  suggest that her British and Indian identities may be tried on
                  or taken off at will.

                  The second installation, entitled <em>Peckham = Uganda</em>,
                  similarly comprised a set of enigmatic photographs of found
                  objects, mainly dolls and childhood toys arranged atop rocks
                  or within abstracted, empty fields (<a href="#akyoung-fig8">Fig. 8</a>). In most cases, the objects were placed on the floor or
                  viewed from unusual angles; sometimes, the rug or floor alone
                  was all that was captured in the frame. The images were paired
                  with a disjointed narrative that described memories related to
                  assault, fear, and police violence in both Uganda and Britain.
                  While Bhimji’s texts offered a view into the visceral
                  experience of living through a civil war, the images in both
                  installations were comparatively inscrutable.

                  Writing for the Financial Times, Petherbridge devoted to
                  Bhimji the highest word count of all the artists exhibiting in
                  <em>From Two Worlds</em>.&nbsp;More specifically, she targets the
                  artist’s use, or alleged <em>mis</em>use, of the photo-text
                  installation format. After discussing Rasheed Araeen’s piece
                  <em>Look Mama…Macho</em> (1986), which draws inspiration from
                  Frantz Fanon’s <em>Black Skin, White Masks,</em> and contains,
                  in Petherbridge’s description, “photographs of blood and
                  slaughter” meant to symbolize religious ritual, the critic
                  then posits an affinity between Araeen's and Bhimji's works,
                  writing that “Zarina Bhimji has also chosen to work within the
                  conventions of the cultural models of the photo-text
                  practice”. She continues,
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Zarina’s family fled Idi Amin’s dictatorship when she was
                    11, and her personal experiences are incorporated within the
                    work following the conventions of feminist practice where
                    personal and political are opposed as a dialectic. Although
                    her red photographic images of clothes—embroidered skull
                    caps and abandoned saris—are poignant and sad, [the] rigid
                    alienation techniques of this very specific form of
                    art-practice are shown up as being inadequate for her
                    needs.<br>
                    <br>
                    In exhibitions of black or non-European artists working in
                    Britain, criticisms have been made of inadequate uses of
                    cultural models: What is not observed is that perhaps the
                    standard and restricted models of mainstream Western art are
                    not adequate for the passion, the newness, or the discord of
                    the message.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">35</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Petherbridge seems to appreciate the tender beauty of Bhimji’s
                  photographs, yet expresses some hesitation with regard to the
                  artist’s choice of a “rigid” artistic format that had been
                  used to comment on issues of representation or mass media by
                  postmodern artists such as Barbara Kruger, Adrian Piper, and
                  Lorna Simpson in the United States, and by Mitra Tabrizian and
                  Victor Burgin in Britain. She brings certain expectations to
                  her encounter with Bhimji’s work, whereby the “message”
                  projected in works by “black and non-European artists” is seen
                  in opposition to art that is “standard” and “mainstream”—terms
                  that establish the modernist white artist as a normative or
                  neutral aesthetic standard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is much to unpack in this view that Bhimji’s work is
                  somehow disconnected to the aims of photo-text installation.
                  For one, this claim reflects wider divisions emerging within
                  fields concerned with identity politics, such as feminist art,
                  around this time. As the critic Janet Wolff has explained, for
                  instance, the photo-text format had been relegated to one side
                  of a rigid boundary that separated “the cerebral” from “the
                  intuitive” as conceptual aims in women’s art practices since
                  the 1970s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">36</a></sup>
                  This dichotomy is one among many binary oppositions that were
                  debated within feminist circles, such as “‘scripto-visual’
                  work versus painting; deconstruction versus celebration;
                  theory versus experience; and elitism versus
                  accessibility”.&nbsp;To this point, by opening her own discussion
                  on Bhimji’s work with a statement on the artist’s diasporic
                  background, Petherbridge suggests from the start that because
                  the work’s content is likely biographical or personal, her use
                  of a “critical” aesthetic format appeared to transgress the
                  boundaries that separated these two distinct methods of
                  practice. In contrast to the cool and ironic style associated
                  with the media-savvy generation that preceded her, for which
                  photo-text art may be most suited, Bhimji’s work seemed too
                  diaristic and intimate. As Petherbridge suggests, more
                  generously, the format itself was perhaps too rigid a choice
                  for her distinctive artistic vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The difficulty of placing Bhimji within the photo-text genre
                  can be read between the lines of much commentary on this stage
                  of her practice, and is alluded to, for instance, in Kellie
                  Jones’s significant <em>Artforum</em> essay “In Their Own
                  Image” (1990)<em>.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">37</a></sup>
                  In this piece, Jones writes about the ways in which Black
                  women artists on both sides of the Atlantic make use of the
                  photo-text method. She claims astutely that the genre’s
                  efficacy stems, in part, from is ability to mirror “the way
                  photographs usually circulate in the world: in magazines,
                  newspapers, and advertising, and on television an image is
                  always accompanied by a verbal cue”, noting that adding text
                  “can also expand the meaning of a single image”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">38</a></sup>
                  Such works, Jones explains, provocatively address “the
                  commodification and objectification of women”, while in some
                  cases, “strident texts appropriate a ‘male’ voice, critiquing
                  the foundations of authority”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">39</a></sup>
                  These descriptions best suit examples such as Mitra
                  Tabrizian’s renderings of movie posters (1986–1987) that
                  feature “women who appropriate femininity as power” (<a href="#akyoung-fig9">Fig. 9</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">40</a></sup>
                  Jones connects Bhimji’s more introspective photographs to this
                  group by way of her attention to “the broader issues of
                  migration, displacement and identity”, but she also writes
                  that her images depict “vaguely defined objects connected with
                  ‘Indianness’”, that “float in and out of view” and are often
                  encountered as “large, at times grainy, photographs” in which
                  the images are blurred, overexposed, or somehow
                  unresolved—qualities that seem at odds with the
                  confrontational and slick aesthetics of much postmodernist
                  photo-text installation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">41</a></sup>

                  It is to these early works and their reception that we may
                  trace the origin of what Jumabhoy calls “the problem of
                  situating Bhimji”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">42</a></sup>
                  The artist’s work is undoubtedly informed by third-wave
                  feminist literature, and by her own experiences as an Asian
                  woman and an immigrant in Britain. Thus critics expect to
                  encounter a deconstructive practice—perhaps signaled by
                  operations of appropriation or the use of mass media
                  artifacts—but instead they find a more intimate and elusive
                  art. Following these observations, most recent scholarship on
                  Bhimji’s practice has acknowledged its enigmatic nature. For
                  instance, T.J. Demos identifies in Bhimji’s recent work an
                  “aesthetics of opacity … a poetics of the image disconnected
                  from background information”, the implications of which he
                  sensitively&nbsp;outlines with regards to Bhimji’s diasporic
                  identity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">43</a></sup>
                  As he puts it, Bhimji’s later filmic works “‘speak’ … with a
                  telling silence”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">44</a></sup>
                  Likewise, responding to the observation that “Bhimji herself
                  has for years been vitriolic” about the subject of racial
                  categorization, Jumabhoy aligns the artist’s “hazy” aesthetic
                  with the theories of cultural hybridity espoused by Homi
                  Bhabha and others, linking her imagery to Bhabha’s own “swishy
                  language, the unraveling sentence structures, the muddying of
                  metaphors” that offer ambiguity in both content and form.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">45</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Expanding on the work of these and other scholars, I propose a
                  kind of lateral view across art history—one that seeks
                  connections across modalities and movements without
                  necessarily making a claim that such interrelationships are
                  derivative or directly consequential to one another. Bhimji’s
                  photo-text work can be understood, for example, through the
                  lens of a wider range of local artistic models than the cohort
                  with whom she most often exhibited. Specifically, her emphasis
                  on affect, memory and the symbolic use of childhood or
                  domestic objects, and her blending of the “critical” and the
                  “intimate”, may have its roots in another constellation of
                  artists working in and out of London at this time, mainly
                  Bhimji’s tutor, the conceptual artist Mary Kelly (but also
                  Susan Hiller, Helen Chadwick, and others).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kelly’s work of the late twentieth century combines the stark
                  didacticism of conceptual art with disarmingly personal
                  subject matter, which sometimes includes abject bodily
                  reference. She has resisted the appellation “feminist artist”,
                  despite her work’s engagement with themes surrounding women’s
                  embodied and psychological experiences. In the artist’s words,
                  “you have to talk about feminist interventions in art practice
                  and not ‘feminist art’”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">46</a></sup>
                  Thus, poised between the boundaries of several post-war
                  movements, her practice has been subject to critique on all
                  sides: conceptual artists bristled at her inclusion of
                  references to motherhood and child-rearing in an otherwise
                  stark and theory-driven artistic field, while feminist artists
                  often found her work alienating and inaccessible.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">47</a></sup>
                  In ways that echo my characterization of Bhimji’s inclination
                  in the 1980s, Griselda Pollock has described Kelly’s filmic
                  and artistic practice according to qualities of negation,
                  which are shared by that of Laura Mulvey and other avant-garde
                  filmmakers in 1970s London, for instance, “the refusal to opt
                  either for social realism and political immediacy or formalism
                  and self-referentiality”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">48</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the multivalence of Kelly’s practice cannot be captured
                  in full herein, I wish to focus on a facet of her work that
                  has been brilliantly examined by Margaret Iversen, which is
                  her oeuvre’s apparent engagement with (and perhaps,
                  intervention in) surrealist aesthetics via psychoanalytic
                  theory. The combination, in Kelly's practice, of purposefully
                  disorienting or distancing visual methods with a deep
                  interrogation of subjectivity and the body, opens up new
                  interpretive pathways that we may bring to Bhimji’s own early
                  work, specifically her focus on symbolic part-objects and the
                  relationship of text and image. As with Bhimji’s later
                  practice, Kelly resists figural representation in many of her
                  installations made during the 1970s and 1980s, which instead
                  feature articles of clothing, indices of touch, and unfiltered
                  writing as a gateway to questions of subjectivity and the
                  subconscious. These works originate, Iversen proposes, in a
                  modernist interrogation of the subconscious that can be traced
                  to the early twentieth-century avant-garde, and not
                  necessarily in the postmodern politics of representation,
                  although the latter provides a crucial framework for the
                  development of both artists’ work. Toward the thesis that
                  Bhimji’s photo-text work is ultimately intended as a poetic
                  articulation of memory, the following section proposes an
                  alternate artistic lineage for Bhimji’s distinctly enigmatic
                  visions of diaspora experience.

                <p>
                  While connections between Bhimji and Kelly have not been
                  ventured in the scholarship on Bhimji’s work, aside from a
                  brief (and important) mention in a footnote in Demos’s
                  aforementioned essay, traces of this relationship can be found
                  scattered throughout archival materials and lesser-known
                  primary sources. Bhimji mentioned the influence of her tutor
                  in a 1992 radio interview with Mark Haworth-Booth, when she
                  describes the formative nature of her experience at
                  Goldsmiths; she briefly recalls that “Mary Kelly was teaching
                  there at the time” and notes the influence of women’s student
                  groups, adding that “I’d never read poetry or come across
                  poetry in my life before […] so I learnt things like
                  that”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">49</a></sup>
                  Further, the connection is noted in a 1987 article by Anandi
                  Ramamurthy in <em>Artrage Magazine</em>, which discusses the
                  work of several Asian artists. Succinctly anticipating some of
                  the arguments that I hope to develop here, Ramamurthy writes:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    We are all living in Britain and we are by no means
                    oblivious to the experimentation and creativity that is
                    going on around us. Zarina Bhimji’s work for example, has
                    been influenced by Mary Kelly and other white feminist
                    artists. Like Mary Kelly, she too creates portraits of
                    herself through her clothes and belongings, but her works
                    are less time specific and evoke a multiplicity of
                    emotions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">50</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Born in Iowa in 1941, Kelly lived in London from 1967 to 1987.
                  She was involved with the Berwick Street Film Collective in
                  the early 1970s and attended Saint Martin’s School of Art,
                  known for its cultivation of an advanced conceptual art
                  cohort. She held a teaching position at Goldsmiths from 1977
                  to 1987. The distinct character of her artistic style—marked
                  by an emphasis on repetition, seriality, and duration—is
                  perhaps indebted to her training at Saint Martins, yet her
                  practice developed in what she called the “open space” left
                  unexplored by her male peers, who were reluctant to address
                  the gendered condition of subjectivity through a
                  deconstructive lens. “I did want to shift the emphasis from
                  the notion of the analytical proposition to a more synthetic
                  process”, she notes. “In my case, obviously, the founding
                  condition is an investigation of the subject”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">51</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Affect and theory work in tandem in Kelly’s art to encourage
                  the viewer’s emotional identification with her subjects, an
                  aim which is made possible through the auratic nature of
                  individual artifacts and texts. In her seminal installation,
                  <em>Post-Partum Document</em>, Kelly draws from psychoanalytic
                  discourse on femininity and motherhood in order to align her
                  “insistent and almost intuitive” desire for theory with “the
                  cathexis of the everyday experience of mothering”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">52</a></sup>
                  Completed in 1973–1979, the installation comprises six parts,
                  with the later stages unfolding during Kelly’s tenure&nbsp;at
                  Goldsmiths. Each presents material objects that index the
                  evolving relationship between the artist and her infant son:
                  wool vests, diaper liners, and examples of the child’s
                  scribbles, writings, and speech acts (<a href="#akyoung-fig10">Fig. 10</a>). These artifacts are accompanied by analytic diagrams and
                  diary-like texts written by the artist; such private traces
                  are then sorted, classified, and preserved, re-enacting the
                  mother’s attempts to postpone the loss of her son to the world
                  of language and culture. Kelly mines her diagrams from
                  psychoanalytic literature and from Western aesthetic and
                  philosophical history, emphasizing the legacy of Enlightenment
                  visuality through allusions to thinkers such as Leon Battista
                  Alberti and René Descartes. In so doing, she absorbed a then
                  recent wave of critical theory that described modernism as a
                  pervasive epistemological system, which itself must be
                  deconstructed before any real social change could be expected.
                  Yet Kelly insists on a kind of haptic aesthetic not present in
                  much deconstructive art; as she later remarked, “there’s no
                  point at which it can become a critical engagement if the
                  viewer is not first—immediately and affectively—drawn into the
                  work”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53">53</a></sup>

                  The dualities and oppositions inherent in&nbsp;Kelly's&nbsp;work reveal
                  the double-bind that women artists—and others whose
                  perspectives have been erased within high modernist
                  discourse—had to negotiate as feminist art and politics gained
                  visibility in the 1970s. Debuted at the Institute of
                  Contemporary Art, London, <em>Post-Partum Document</em> was
                  lambasted and ridiculed for the inclusion of “dirty nappies”
                  in the galleries; those who were sympathetic to the modernist
                  project of artistic autonomy vilified the installation’s
                  body-oriented materiality. On the other hand, many felt that
                  her work’s emphasis on theory was alienating, even
                  *anti-*feminist, “too cerebral and obscure”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54">54</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Within the contradictory space between these critiques lies
                  one of the primary affinities between Kelly and Bhimji: both
                  artists are deeply interested in the politics of the body, yet
                  refuse to directly represent it in their work. Referring to
                  the performative gestures that came to define feminist art
                  practice in her generation, Kelly later explained, “a number
                  of women used their own bodies or images to raise questions
                  about gender, but it was not that effective, in part because
                  this was what women in art were expected to do”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55">55</a></sup>
                  Bhimji has likewise very rarely produced representations of
                  the body in her art; the primary exception among her
                  photo-text works—the 1989 installation&nbsp;<em>Live for Sharam and Die for Izzat</em>—contains images only of a nude male figure (<a href="#akyoung-fig11">Figs. 11</a>
                  and <a href="#akyoung-fig12">12</a>). The absence of the
                  artist’s own body works strategically against (white) viewers’
                  preconceived expectations for her work. In fact, Kelly has
                  likewise hinted that her decision not to picture the body was
                  meant as a preventative measure against women’s own
                  subconscious “identification with the male voyeur”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56">56</a></sup>

                  In her 1997 essay, “Visualizing the Unconscious”, Iversen
                  traces many of Kelly’s artistic choices to surrealist art, an
                  unexpected source that nonetheless casts works like
                  <em>Corpus</em> in a new light. She focuses on Kelly’s direct
                  engagement with concepts in psychoanalysis, a point of
                  departure shared with André Breton and his surrealist cohort,
                  who sought to envision the workings of the unconscious mind
                  using methods like automatism and dream-work. As Iversen
                  explains, “the combination in Surrealism and in Kelly’s work
                  of psychoanalysis, politics, word-image art practice, found
                  objects, as well as ‘ethnographic research’ and documentation,
                  makes the comparison compelling”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57">57</a></sup>
                  While the writer warns of some significant ideological
                  differences—namely, the culture of sexism (and I would add
                  primitivism) that characterized many of the surrealists’
                  exploits—this reading nonetheless opens up an alternate
                  art-historical lineage for certain photo-text practices of the
                  later twentieth century that seem slightly out of sync with
                  the deconstructive or media-centric methods of postmodernist
                  art. If we may further triangulate this lineage—that is to
                  say, to position surrealism, Kelly, and later Bhimji in
                  dialogue—we might understand that the younger artist’s work
                  need not be written off as semiotically illegible or “closed”
                  to critique, as has often been proposed; rather, it succeeds
                  at an entirely different aim: the articulation of her personal
                  experience not through iconographic representation but rather
                  through the illogical and enigmatic languages of dreams,
                  memory, and the irrational.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Iversen explains, for instance, that articles of clothing
                  often functioned in surrealist art as fetishes that signified
                  the absent body, as in Meret Oppenheim’s sculpture of bound
                  shoes (<em>Object</em>, 1936), Giorgio de Chirico’s paintings
                  of gloves and other isolated hand-like forms (such as in
                  <em>The Song of Love</em>, 1914), and André Breton’s
                  cast-bronze sculpture of a woman’s glove (<em>Gant de Femme</em>, 1926). She asserts that the images in Kelly’s
                  <em>Corpus</em> may have been inspired by the latter—that
                  “article of clothing suggesting a metonymy of part for whole
                  (the glove standing in for the whole woman) and having a
                  definite expressive character” (<a href="#akyoung-fig15">Fig. 15</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58">58</a></sup>

                <p>
                  To create <em>Corpus</em>, Kelly applied semi-transparent
                  photographic laminates directly to the Perspex. Each image
                  would cast a faint shadow behind it, “emphasizing the space or
                  gap behind”. For Iversen, this effect bears resemblance to
                  works on glass by Marcel Duchamp, such as
                  <em>Glider Containing a Watermill (1913–1915)</em>, which
                  “sits on a hinge attached to the wall and throws a shadow on
                  the wall”, just as Kelly’s images of jackets and vests cast a
                  shadow on the matter within the frame.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59">59</a></sup>
                  As she explains, quoting the artist:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Kelly gives us a clue to what she found valuable in this
                    work and the photographs when she contrasts the function of
                    perspective construction, in which the surface of the
                    picture is tied to a geometric point and conceived as the
                    intersection of a pyramidal path of light, with another kind
                    of picture found in “the realm of lost objects”, a realm
                    where “vanishing points are determined not by geometry, but
                    by
                    <em>what is real for the subject, points linked, not to a
                      surface, but to a place—the unconscious—and not by means
                      of light, but by the laws of primary process</em>”<em>.</em><br>
                    <br>
                    Orthodox perspective construction was either entirely
                    disposed of, or skewed and exaggerated, as in painting by de
                    Chirico or Dalí.
                    <em>But for the representation of lost-objects, traces of
                      experience or traumas cut off from consciousness, the
                      object is perhaps best represented as isolated, floating
                      in an uncharted space</em>. [my emphasis]<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60">60</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Above, Iversen posits that new types of perspectival
                  construction seen in surrealist photography are visually
                  representative of unconscious states; such images depart from
                  the conventions of naturalism, whose aim is to transcribe
                  “reality” in an objectively accurate and recognizable (iconic)
                  manner. This effect can also be discerned in Bhimji’s early
                  photographs, which utilize a generous manipulation of aperture
                  and other techniques of distortion. Bhimji has remarked that
                  early in her studies, she was “interested in the idea that you
                  could photograph something in macro lens and blow it up so
                  big” to present a humble subject in monumental scale or
                  heightened focus.&nbsp;This brings&nbsp;to mind canonical examples of
                  surrealist photography such as Brassaï’s
                  <em>Sculptures Involontaires</em> (<a href="#akyoung-fig16">Fig. 16</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61">61</a></sup>
                  Across her early works, subjects are often severely
                  foreshortened, portrayed from a child’s point of view, as
                  depicted from a standing position, with the camera pointed
                  toward the floor or her own feet.

                  Iversen’s invocation of Duchamp’s works on glass is especially
                  pertinent to Bhimji’s own lesser-known experiments in&nbsp;the same
                  medium. In Bhimji’s installation <em>Peckham = Uganda</em>,
                  exhibited in <em>From Two Worlds</em>, the artist did not make
                  use of paper at all. Grey picture frames were transformed into
                  shallow display boxes, into which she placed pieces of muslin
                  embedded with typed prose, which is printed on the cloth
                  itself. She exposed six photographic images directly onto the
                  sheets of glass that are set within these frames, using an
                  emulsion called liquid light—a light-sensitive colloid that
                  can be spread over any surface to create a photographic
                  substrate. Using this method, the artist produced a ghostly,
                  ethereal effect in which each semi-transparent image&nbsp;hovers
                  over thin lines of text. In a similar manner to
                  <em>Corpus</em>, the wall-mounted installation comprises
                  floating images that create the shadow effect previously
                  described (<a href="#akyoung-fig17">Fig. 17</a>).

                  The use of transparency and hovering images serves to mimic
                  and exaggerate the suspenseful compositions of Bhimji’s
                  photographs. For instance, one image depicts a small figurine,
                  which is cropped and diagonally angled such that it appears to
                  be lying on its back. While miniscule, the object occupies the
                  majority of the composition and is further magnified by its
                  isolation within an empty visual field. Another image in the
                  sequence features a baby doll lying unclothed on a sullied
                  surface; her plastic eyelids are lightly shut and her tousled
                  hair is covered in a sticky substance. The doll’s face and
                  chest are lit from above. Bhimji’s camera scrutinizes the form
                  of the head with her macro lens, as individual hairs and bits
                  of dust catch light and focus. In a third photograph, Bhimji
                  captures a broader spread of fragmented objects: a child’s
                  shoe (its strap unfastened), the detached leg of a plastic
                  doll (à la Hans Bellmer, perhaps), and other objects resting
                  on a stone surface. The image is shot from directly overhead
                  in bright sunlight, such that each object’s shadow is cast
                  just beneath it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bhimji’s photographs appear to allude to the visual
                  presentation of dreams and fantasies, and the repression of
                  trauma. Precedents for her aesthetic choices may also be found
                  in the surrealists, who were suspicious, at first, of
                  photography’s capacity to visualize the unconscious. Breton
                  was famously skeptical about images, in general, favoring
                  automatic writing as a method through which the “pure
                  creations of the mind” could be channeled. As Rosalind Krauss
                  explains, photography’s indexicality is potentially
                  problematic because of its close ties to the physical
                  world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn62" id="fnref62">62</a></sup>
                  Because we often <em>expect</em> photography be realistic, any
                  apparent “distortions” will appear artificially derived.

                <p>
                  However, as Victor Burgin has commented, retinal images seen
                  by the human eye are already inverted and distorted. He
                  writes:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    We make mental allowances for the known relative sizes of
                    objects which override the actual relative sizes of their
                    images on our retina; we also make allowances for
                    perspectival effects such as foreshortening, the foundation
                    of the erroneous popular judgment that such effects in
                    photography are “distortions”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn63" id="fnref63">63</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  As he later concludes, “seeing is not an activity divorced
                  from the rest of consciousness”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn64" id="fnref64">64</a></sup>
                  Surrealist images, then, draw attention to the hidden
                  mechanics of vision; naturalism in art is, in fact,
                  <em>less</em> real and <em>more</em> manipulated. For
                  photography to further embody the tenets of surrealism, the
                  medium needed to be dislodged from its status as a narrative
                  document that simply recorded the real. If artists could
                  disorient and distort the photographic image, perhaps the real
                  itself could be recast as surreal. Likewise, Krauss posits
                  that photography’s indexicality works in service of surrealism
                  when the image is able to express “the paradox of reality
                  constructed as a sign—or presence transformed into absence,
                  into representational space, into spacing, into writing”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn65" id="fnref65">65</a></sup>
                  This is achieved through experimentation with the medium
                  itself, such as “solarization, negative printing, cliché
                  verre, multiple exposure, photomontage, and photocollage”, to
                  which we may add the ghostly result of developing with liquid
                  light, although straight photography can also dislocate
                  reality.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn66" id="fnref66">66</a></sup>
                  In essence, surrealist photography performs a kind of visual
                  automatism wherein the world writes itself—through the use of
                  isolation, cropping or framing, through manipulating scale and
                  point of view, such images model “the experience of nature as
                  a sign or representation”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn67" id="fnref67">67</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  While Kelly’s installations reproduce the isolating effect of
                  surrealist photographs, Bhimji may have also found precedent
                  in the work of artists like Mari Mahr, whose
                  surrealist-inspired photographs featuring displaced or
                  fragmented objects were on view in several (solo and group)
                  exhibitions in London throughout the 1980s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn68" id="fnref68">68</a></sup>
                  Born in Chile in 1951, Mahr arrived in England after studying
                  photojournalism in Budapest during the 1960s and 1970s, but
                  quickly abandoned the documentary style.&nbsp;Interested in memory,
                  imagination, and fantasy, Mahr photographed “ephemeral
                  objects, insignificant in themselves, which may nevertheless
                  carry a charge powerful enough to release memories and
                  associations long since buried”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn69" id="fnref69">69</a></sup>
                  Bhimji even noted some similarities between her practice and
                  Mahr’s, such as Mahr’s use of document art paper (which lent
                  the photograph an object-like tactility).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn70" id="fnref70">70</a></sup>
                  What is more striking is the way each artist subverts the
                  verisimilitude of photography through manipulations in scale,
                  strange juxtapositions, and imagery that appears haunting or
                  elegiac (<a href="#akyoung-fig18">Fig. 18</a>). Nigel Finch,
                  for instance, describes the quotidian sources of Mahr’s
                  inspiration in a way that echoes Bhimji’s descriptions of her
                  own work, writing that “she seemed to be fabricating a world
                  from glimpsed events, snippets of overheard conversations, and
                  borrowed objects”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn71" id="fnref71">71</a></sup>
                  As immigrant artists living in a society different from the
                  one in which they were raised, perhaps Bhimji and Mahr shared
                  a heightened awareness of details in the visual environment
                  that others fail to notice; even the most everyday signs and
                  utterances can be rich in aesthetic impact and easily rendered
                  strange.

                  Mahr added handwritten texts to some of her photographs in&nbsp;her
                  early series, <em>Movie Pictures</em> (1980), widening the
                  range of associations invited by her images. In fact, both
                  Kelly and Bhimji likewise include traces of linguistic rhymes,
                  doubles, and automatic processes in their photo-text work,
                  recalling the automatist experimentations and wordplay of the
                  surrealists. In <em>Corpus</em>, cursive texts are
                  silkscreened directly onto the backs of each Plexiglass sheet
                  paired with an image of clothing (<a href="#akyoung-fig19">Fig. 19</a>). Kelly’s hand-rendering of her texts ensures that these
                  narratives can be read as indexes, or in her words, “as a
                  texture of writing, as evidence of the body”. She explains
                  that “[t]he use of the first personal indicative feels as if
                  you’re listening to someone speaking. It’s about that
                  experience of the voice”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn72" id="fnref72">72</a></sup>
                  Moreover, the viewer is able to see herself reflected in the
                  Perspex, “inviting pleasurable identification with the
                  characters” who describe each anecdote. The work speaks to the
                  power of a collective unconscious, a chorus of “many bodies,
                  shaped within a lot of different discourses”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn73" id="fnref73">73</a></sup>

                  As such, turning finally to the text that Bhimji includes in
                  <em>Peckham = Uganda</em>, both the narrative and the form of
                  her writing seem to reflect such processes as psychoanalytic
                  excavation or dreamwork. Again, it is only in looking
                  <em>through</em> the transparent images that the viewer may
                  approach the written words, suggesting that these components
                  are in dialogue with one another, and with the viewer’s
                  reflection, and thus unfold simultaneously in real time.
                  Beginning with the photograph of the toy&nbsp;figurine, her prose
                  opens with a subtle allusion to that image:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Bapa and I arrived in Uganda<br>
                    at our old home.<br>
                    During the troubles, while<br>
                    Amin’s army was about,<br>
                    we all sleep together in the<br>
                    same bedroom.
                    <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn74" id="fnref74">74</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Such passages move between past and present tenses, implying a
                  narrative that hovers in the shifting space and time of
                  memory, dreams, or déjà vu. The format of her telling
                  exemplifies what Freud called “secondary revision”, which
                  describes “the act of ordering, revising, and supplementing
                  the contents of the dream so as to make a more intelligible
                  whole out of it”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn75" id="fnref75">75</a></sup>
                  Narrative pathways are created between disparate photographs
                  in the installation. Bhimji’s prose, for instance, continues
                  beneath the second photograph, which depicts toys scattered
                  across a stone surface, offering similar resonance between
                  image and text:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  In the remaining texts, Bhimji describes scenes of
                  violence—perhaps drawn from memory, dreams, or pure
                  fiction—that shift between the contexts of Uganda and Britain.
                  She writes, “They are bombarding our / verandah broken
                  bottles. / or is it bullets?” “Bapa is angry. / He wants to
                  kill a white / policewoman”. “I won’t let him, I say that if
                  he / rapes her it / would be the same as raping / me”. As one
                  “reads” the installation, violence is no longer a veiled or
                  muted undertone; it acquires urgency as the text continues,
                  culminating in the description of a coffin; “He is wrapped in
                  a Muslin / cloth. It is / gradually turning red”. Later, the
                  text references racist attacks associated with the rise of the
                  National Front: “The N.F. / has killed him”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the piece does refer to some known aspects of the
                  artist’s biography, it also contains fabricated scenes,
                  illogically merging references across place and time. Her
                  text, thus, should not be decoded as if biographically
                  accurate but rather treated as akin to a kind of dreamwork,
                  which would feature “real” people acting in unreal scenarios.
                  As Burgin explains, citing Freud, “in dreams, words and
                  phrases are just meaningful elements among others, accorded no
                  more or less status than are images, and their meanings have
                  no necessary relation to the meanings they would carry in
                  waking speech”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn77" id="fnref77">77</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When confronted with readings that overemphasize the
                  biographical nature of her art, Bhimji has typically retorted
                  that her work is intuitive and that her images are open to
                  multiple associations. “I don’t consciously decide to
                  photograph particular objects. I mean particular Indian
                  objects”, she later clarified. “But over the years I’ve
                  realized that I’ve been doing that without knowing it”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn78" id="fnref78">78</a></sup>
                  She has elsewhere written about her creative process as
                  intuitive, rather than premeditated, commenting that she
                  prefers to photograph “objects which are personal to me as
                  well as various images, conversations, bits of cloth, food
                  labels … I collect because they either trigger some memory or
                  because I like them and relate to them on different levels”,
                  adding that “the image lies in front of me, and my diary, and
                  the work begins”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn79" id="fnref79">79</a></sup>

                  Poetry and Art as Pathways to Empathy
                </h1>
                <p>
                  If Bhimji’s photo-text work can be understood as representing
                  memory or the irrational content of dreams, one may reasonably
                  ask next, to what end? Inviting the viewer to create “mental
                  images” (both in image and text), rather than offering
                  straight documentary images, is not merely a stylistic
                  preference;&nbsp;it also serves to encourage a more genuinely
                  empathetic response from viewers. The word “poetic” is often
                  used to describe Bhimji’s images on the basis of their
                  indirectness, and this is no coincidence given her love of
                  that literary genre. On more than one occasion, in fact,
                  Bhimji has substituted lines of poetry in lieu of an artist
                  statement. Throughout the late 1980s especially, one of her
                  most oft-cited passages came from T.S. Eliot’s poem&nbsp;<em>Ash Wednesday</em>, from which Bhimji frequently extracted and reprinted the
                  following lines:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Lady of Silences<br>
                    calm and distressed<br>
                    torn and most whole<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn80" id="fnref80">80</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  These words grace the label for an untitled photograph in the
                  Arts Council Collection, which depicts a tableaux of shorn
                  hair, chiffon, and rose petals. The caption reads, “In this
                  work, [Bhimji] wanted to capture the feeling of ‘being fragile
                  and yet whole’ and ‘beauty, yet sadness’”, before quoting the
                  above verse.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn81" id="fnref81">81</a></sup>
                  Eliot’s poetry is famously elusive: rich in symbolism and
                  difficult to conclusively decode. The “lady of silences”, for
                  instance, as G. Douglas Atkins has pointed out, is “an
                  enigmatic and for many a perplexing if not contradictory
                  figure”, about whom many readers likely feign understanding.
                  Atkins admits that “paraphrasable content, as it were, holds
                  little interest or value” for the poet.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn82" id="fnref82">82</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bhimji’s desire to invite many possible associations is, of
                  course, so common an approach taken by visual artists that it
                  is almost not worth mentioning. However, given the context of
                  representational politics which this article has presented,
                  such a stance may be traced not only to a personal aesthetic
                  taste but also to what Mercer calls the “burden of
                  representation”—the widespread expectation that Black artists
                  must shoulder the responsibility of “speaking as
                  ‘representatives’ in the sense that they are expected to
                  ‘speak for’ the black communities from which they come”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn83" id="fnref83">83</a></sup>
                  Bhimji explained as much when she cited
                  <em>Ash Wednesday</em> in the context of her preparations for
                  the 1989 Whitechapel Open. “The gallery thought I was making a
                  piece about trying to break out of Asian boundaries”, she
                  recalls. “It had absolutely nothing to do with that. I
                  responded by sending them a quote by T.S. Eliot. … You see, it
                  was about loss of innocence and not about being an Asian
                  woman”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn84" id="fnref84">84</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A lady of silences herself, Bhimji used the term “silence” not
                  only in her degree show, mentioned earlier, but also in the
                  title of the most celebrated photo-text installation of her
                  early career,
                  <em>She Loved to Breathe—Pure Silence</em> (1987) (<a href="#akyoung-fig20">Fig. 20</a>), which presents an elegiac meditation on loss, resilience,
                  and memory. In this piece, four double-sided Plexiglass panels
                  hang suspended from the ceiling by wire, floating above a
                  scattering of powdered turmeric and red chili on the floor
                  below. Rose-tinted photographs face out from each side of the
                  Plexiglass panels, layered over thin swatches of muslin cloth.
                  They depict a range of intimate objects that shift in and out
                  of focus: embroidered slippers, a dead bird, a piece of metal
                  jewelry. Some are intentionally blurred to the point of near
                  illegibility, as in the image of a sparrow, placed delicately
                  on its back: the bird’s recumbent body dissolves into a foggy
                  aura of white light, as both figure and ground remain
                  frustratingly out of the viewer’s reach. Such images are
                  paired with fragmentary textual phrases, dry-transferred via
                  Letraset onto the muslin,&nbsp;which fail to form a cohesive
                  storyline. “The anger turned inwards”, one reads. “Where could
                  it go except to make pain?”

                <p>
                  Most literature on
                  <em>She Loved to Breathe—Pure Silence</em> focuses on the
                  work’s fourth panel, which offers subtle iconographic
                  allusions. One side contains a set of latex gloves, pressed
                  between muslin and Plexiglass. This is a reference to the
                  harrowing experience of Indian&nbsp;immigrant women who, as
                  reported by the <em>Guardian</em> in 1979, were “intimately
                  examined, to determine their virginity, by Home Office
                  officials—wearing surgical gloves”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn85" id="fnref85">85</a></sup>
                  The other side reveals a transferred image of the artist’s own
                  visa stamp, permitting her entry to Britain as a young refugee
                  from Uganda. This panel appears to signify the inhumanity of
                  border regulations, the politics of space, and the
                  individual’s struggle for agency within it. Yet Bhimji has
                  been persistent in her rejection of any historic,
                  biographical, or cultural specificity in this piece,
                  explaining, “it is not just about virginity tests—that is
                  simply one example and a reminder of what life can be outside
                  gallery walls”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn86" id="fnref86">86</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The texts, expectedly, do not form a cohesive narrative across
                  the sequence; rather, they seem like a collection of voices
                  collaged together, alternating between grammatical tenses and
                  a range of characters. Each describes an incident of hostility
                  toward immigrants or women, and many commentators have
                  concluded (with partial accuracy) that the texts “comment on
                  the experience of Pakistani immigrants” or reflect “the
                  forcefulness of spoken declaration, the anger of response, the
                  violence of racism”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn87" id="fnref87">87</a></sup>
                  The most oft-cited line of text is inscribed above the pair of
                  surgical gloves: “Sometimes there, white people on their way
                  to work laughed at their Indianness&nbsp; … shouted PAKI: APRI
                  BHENOI … sucked their teeth, dismissing them”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It has not been revealed in extant scholarship on
                  <em>She Loved to Breathe—Pure Silence</em> that these texts
                  are not, in fact, written by Bhimji, but instead are extracted
                  from a variety of literary sources. Each is rooted in a
                  different historical condition of exile or diaspora, ranging
                  from narratives on Jewish refugees in Western Europe to
                  Caribbean immigrants in Brooklyn. Another common thread is
                  that each story contains a reflection on the author’s or
                  protagonist’s mother, in many cases as an epitaph. Printed
                  over one of the images of a dead bird, for instance, is a
                  passage drawn from a poem titled “Putting the Good Things
                  Away” by Marge Piercy; it was published in her 1985 anthology,
                  <em>My Mother’s Body</em>, in which the writer reflects on the
                  loss of her mother. The poem begins with an inventory of
                  tactile, symbolic objects:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    In the drawer were folded fine<br>
                    batiste slips embroidered with scrolls<br>
                    and posies, edged with handmade<br>
                    lace too good for her to wear.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn88" id="fnref88">88</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Throughout the poem, Piercy reflects on her elderly mother at
                  rest—“in the coffin she was beautiful”—and on the innate
                  connection between mother and daughter—“our minds were woven
                  together”. The passage that Bhimji quotes marks a shift in the
                  poem’s tone from a sense of nostalgia to one of bitterness and
                  grief:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The anger turned inward, the anger<br>
                    turned inward, where<br>
                    could it go except to make pain?<br>
                    It flowed into me with her milk.<br>
                    <br>
                    Her anger annealed me.<br>
                    I was dipped into the cauldron<br>
                    of boiling rage and rose<br>
                    a warrior and a witch.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn89" id="fnref89">89</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The phrase “anger turned inwards” appears in Freud’s essay,
                  “Mourning and Melancholia”, where he uses these words to
                  describe the physical sensations that accompany melancholy, a
                  form of depression associated, specifically, with the
                  hollowing sadness of grief. As in Bhimji’s installation,
                  Piercy’s grief is expressed through allusions to textiles and
                  other material traces that her mother left behind (<a href="#akyoung-fig21">Figs. 21</a>-<a href="#akyoung-fig25">25</a>).

                  Two panels in the work borrow their prose from a 1959 novel by
                  Paule Marshall, titled <em>Brown Girl, Brownstones</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn90" id="fnref90">90</a></sup>
                  Set in post-war Brooklyn, the book traces the coming-of-age
                  story of Selina Boyce, the daughter of Caribbean
                  immigrants,&nbsp;and speaks to the intersections of gender, sex,
                  and race within a small Barbadian community in New York.
                  Bhimji altered these lines slightly, substituting “Ismaili”
                  for Boyce’s “Bajan” identity. “Slowly she raised her arm”, the
                  line reads, “thin, dark brown the sun-haze circled by two
                  heavy gold bangles. This had come from home—every Ismaili girl
                  wore from birth”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn91" id="fnref91">91</a></sup>
                  Locating cultural identity in heirloom objects, this text
                  hovers above the photograph of jewelry, delicately resting
                  upon a bed of white muslin cloth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, the work’s title can be located in a passage from
                  Albert Cohen’s 1954 novel, <em>Le Livre de ma mere</em> (<em>Book of My Mother</em>), a collection of essays on war and exile that also reflects
                  on solitude, aging, and grief. Cohen’s family migrated from
                  the Greek island of Corfu to Marseilles when he was child. As
                  German forces advanced to France in the early 1940s, Albert
                  moved to London, and it was there “that he received news of
                  the death of his mother” in Marseilles, as David Coward has
                  relayed. “Unable to mourn her, he expressed his grief in a
                  series of articles written for a morale-boosting periodical,
                  <em>La France libre</em>”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn92" id="fnref92">92</a></sup>
                  Like Bhimji, Kelly, and the aforementioned authors, Cohen’s
                  grief is conveyed through the symbolism of trivial objects and
                  pneumonic traces of his mother:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    quince jelly, pink candles, illustrated Thursday papers,
                    plush teddy bears, joys of convalescence, birthdays, New
                    Year letters on jagged-edged notepaper … childhood, little
                    scraps of peace, little scraps of happiness, Maman’s cakes,
                    Maman’s smiles, O all this I shall know no more, O charms, O
                    dead sounds of the past, vanished smoke and withered
                    seasons.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn93" id="fnref93">93</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Near the end of the book, Cohen laments the thought of his
                  mother lying buried in the ground: “She loved to breathe the
                  sea air on those Sundays of my childhood”, he writes. “Why is
                  she now beneath a stifling plank, that plank so close to her
                  beautiful face? She loved to breathe, she loved life.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn94" id="fnref94">94</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In light of these connections, Bhimji’s piece grows more
                  complex than a mere protest of the Heathrow incident. It comes
                  to reflect on the feelings of grief and mourning that are
                  often attendant to experiences of migration and exile. The
                  scattered spices beneath Bhimji’s photographs resonate as a
                  burial, invoking ashes or the blanket of earth that covers a
                  fresh grave. The jeweled shoes signify the absence of feet
                  that may have once slipped into them. Noting an elegiac
                  aesthetics in Bhimji’s later cinematographic works, Achim
                  Borchardt-Hume asked the artist, in 2012, “What motivates this
                  grief?” In an illuminating response, she speaks not about
                  personal loss but about this sensation as being familiar to
                  those who have experienced diaspora:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Although I have relatives in India, because of the long
                    migration period, it takes time to relate. This is what is
                    sad; you can never really go back. Migration is about having
                    to abandon family and friends. I wonder whether it is both,
                    the one who leaves and the one who is left behind …?
                    Separation causes rupture and cultural inheritance is being
                    questioned. The loss of this attachment may awaken anxiety;
                    the new environment may be hostile and therefore
                    assimilation not straightforward. Refugees are forced by
                    circumstance to leave their country with returning home
                    often out of question due to political reasons. This brings
                    isolation and loneliness, and results in a complex process
                    of mourning.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn95" id="fnref95">95</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The poems and passages quoted throughout
                  <em>She Loved to Breathe—Pure Silence</em> are not cited&nbsp;in
                  the installation itself. Their letters dissolve across muslin
                  grounds, representing the whispers of many possible subjects,
                  detached from locations, dates, or names. Bhimji encourages
                  this ambiguity in her use of grammatical shifters such as
                  “she”, “I”, or “here”, each only carrying a temporary
                  reference to a fleeting act of utterance. This should
                  encourage the viewer to transcend the specificity of the
                  artist’s biography to find his or her own story in the images
                  and stories she presents.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Writing on the work of T.S. Eliot, Atkins has suggested that
                  the poet “is interested in something other than an
                  intellectual or merely rational response to literature. He
                  wants the whole person involved, not just ‘the heart’ but also
                  ‘the cerebral cortex, the nervous system, and the digestive
                  tracts’”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn96" id="fnref96">96</a></sup>
                  As this article has shown, Bhimji extends a lineage of artists
                  who have sought to relay the intimate content of memory,
                  dreams, and fantasies, using objects as indices to loss or
                  memory. In Kelly’s <em>Post-Partum Document</em>, for
                  instance, elements such as the artist’s son’s handwriting or
                  the imprint of his hand in clay transform into pneumonic
                  objects; the artist clings to these as she mourns her child’s
                  “entry into the patriarchal order”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn97" id="fnref97">97</a></sup>
                  The absence of figural representation, as asserted above,
                  serves to encourage a mode of identification that is not
                  socially mediated; as Iversen has written, “the intimacy of
                  the index, its relation to the sense of touch, is like an
                  impression on memory which resists verbalization.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn98" id="fnref98">98</a></sup>
                  Like the authors whose texts she has quoted, Bhimji’s
                  photographs invite remembrance&nbsp;by focusing on ordinary objects
                  and images, which gain meaning in their sedimentation in the
                  unconscious over time. “I like to photograph things that are
                  familiar and give them a charged feeling”, she has stated. “I
                  am interested in speaking of that which is hard to speak
                  about. Also, I am very inspired by literature that is quite
                  intimate in the way it will describe something. … There is an
                  intimacy in the writing so that you can almost feel the
                  details from the way they are described”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn99" id="fnref99">99</a></sup>
                  Such comments deepen with consideration of Bhimji’s interest
                  (noted recently by Demos) in the work of the literary theorist
                  Elaine Scarry, whose ideas concern the failure of language to
                  express the subject experience of pain. Writing on the
                  importance of empathy, Scarry explains that “our capacity to
                  injure other people is very great precisely because our
                  capacity to imagine other people is very small”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn100" id="fnref100">100</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yet art and literature have the ability, in&nbsp;Scarry's words, to
                  “incite in our imaginings the vivacity of the perceptual
                  world” and to impact our interpersonal behavior.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn101" id="fnref101">101</a></sup>
                  Bhimji’s work achieves this directive through a range of
                  eloquent formalist strategies that expand both on surrealism’s
                  legacy of engagement with dreams and the visualization of
                  memory and on Mary Kelly’s emphasis on intimate materiality in
                  a feminist context. It is the artist’s wish that her
                  depictions of symbolic objects and poetic texts will “tell
                  stories of personal and cultural significance and create
                  metaphors for people, emotions, and events”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn102" id="fnref102">102</a></sup>
                  Our capacity to imagine others, as Scarry would have it,
                  expands through this encounter.

                        Zarina Bhimji’s CV contains reference to a 1985 group
                        exhibition titled <em>F-Stops</em>, which was held at
                        the gallery of the Chelsea School of Art, but she has
                        not been able to recollect the premise or curatorial
                        framing of this show for the author, and archives could
                        not be located. This presumably gave some inspiration to
                        the title of her 1986 photo-text installation,

                  Introducing Joseph Maclise, Victorian Anatomist
                </h1>
                <p>
                  It was 2007, and I was a PhD student sitting in the special
                  collections room in the Wellcome Library, London, searching
                  for nineteenth-century British images of dissections.
                  Victorian artists and art students most certainly attended,
                  and sometimes even participated in, dissections, but I was
                  struggling to find any visual evidence of it. It was fast
                  becoming apparent that human dissection was considered an
                  inappropriate subject for artistic treatment, and a rather
                  unacceptable undertaking for any respectable Victorian
                  gentleman.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
                  Noticing my frustration, William Schupbach, lead librarian and
                  curator at the Wellcome, presented me with the first British,
                  1851, folio edition of Joseph Maclise’s
                  <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> (<a href="#vaaatml-fig1">Fig. 1</a>). This little-known anatomical production is the jumping-off
                  point for the current One Object feature, “Victorian
                  Anatomical Atlases and Their Many Lives (and Deaths)”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One particularly significant aspect of Maclise’s
                  <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> is that it includes two
                  illustrations of the dissection of a Black man: Plates 5 and
                  14 of the first British edition (<a href="#vaaatml-fig2">Figs. 2</a>
                  and <a href="#vaaatml-fig3">3</a>). I examine Plate 14 in
                  depth in my article for this feature, “Black Apollo:
                  Aesthetics, Dissection, and Race in Maclise’s
                  <em>Surgical Anatomy</em>”. Years after first encountering
                  <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> in the Wellcome Library, I was in
                  the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland, USA,
                  looking for the dissected Black man, only to discover that he
                  was missing from all American editions of the same atlas (<a href="#vaaatml-fig4">Figs. 4</a>, <a href="#vaaatml-fig5">5</a>, and
                  <a href="#vaaatml-fig6">6</a>). The discovery of this
                  mysterious transatlantic erasure was developed into a paper,
                  which I delivered in May 2018 at the “Objects in Motion”
                  workshop in Giverny, France, sponsored by the Terra Foundation
                  for American Art, the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in
                  British Art, and the Yale Center for British Art. It soon
                  became apparent that a comprehensive analysis of the British
                  and American editions of Maclise’s
                  <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> required more voices than just mine.
                  With support from the Terra Foundation, along with Angela
                  McShane, Julia Nurse, and William Schupbach at the Wellcome,
                  and Baillie Card and Sarah Victoria Turner at the Paul Mellon
                  Centre, in April 2019, a remarkable group of historians, art
                  historians, medical historians, curators, and librarians
                  gathered in London to examine “in the flesh” the Wellcome
                  Library’s impressive collection of eighteenth- and
                  nineteenth-century anatomical atlases. The ideas generated by
                  that event formed the basis of the current feature, and I am
                  deeply grateful to everyone who believed in the project and
                  worked to bring it to fruition, above all, the editors of
                  <em>British Art Studies</em>.

                <p>
                  Joseph Maclise was born in Cork, Ireland, in 1815. In the
                  1830s, he studied at University College, London, under Robert
                  Liston and Samuel Cooper, to whom he dedicated
                  <em>Surgical Anatomy</em>. He also studied in Paris at the
                  École Pratique, L’Hôpital de la Pitié. His brother was the
                  successful history painter, Daniel Maclise, and the two
                  travelled together to Paris and other European cities in 1844.
                  Interestingly, several sets of brothers make appearances over
                  the course of this feature: the Maclise brothers, of course,
                  Charles and John Bell, Richard and Jones Quain, and William
                  and John Hunter. Before setting out for Europe with his
                  brother, Maclise produced the illustrations for his former
                  teacher, Richard Quain’s
                  <em>The Anatomy of the Arteries of the Human Body</em>
                  (1844).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
                  In <em>Comparative Osteology</em> of 1847, which Maclise wrote
                  and illustrated, he identified what he termed the “archetype”
                  skeleton, or the complete form from which different skeletal
                  structures derived.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  He claimed to have come up with the concept—or at least this
                  particular use of the term “archetype”—prior to the
                  influential comparative anatomist, and opponent of Charles
                  Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection, Richard
                  Owen.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  Nonetheless, Maclise’s contribution to the study of human and
                  animal anatomy continues to languish in obscurity. Following
                  the publication of the second American edition of
                  <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> in 1859, he published&nbsp;<em>On Dislocations and Fractures</em>
                  and, by the 1860s, had fallen afoul of the medical
                  fraternity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  At this point, the archival trail runs cold, except for
                  Michael Sappol’s remarkable discovery of Maclise’s death
                  certificate (<a href="#vaaatml-fig7">Fig. 7</a>). No
                  obituaries have yet been found.

                  Maclise’s <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> was initially released in
                  four parts, starting in 1848, as an imperial folio with
                  individual fasciculus. In 1851, John Churchill of London, and
                  Blanchard and Lea of Philadelphia, published the atlas as
                  complete first editions. In 1856, Churchill published a second
                  expanded edition and, in 1859, Blanchard and Lea did the same.
                  Henry C. Lea published a smaller, cheaper version in 1870. The
                  atlas presents a series of illustrations of dissections with
                  the purpose of teaching surgeons and aspiring surgeons the
                  anatomical structures relevant to the successful performance
                  of surgical procedures. The preface begins as follows: “The
                  object of this work is to present to the student of medicine
                  and the practitioner removed from the schools, a series of
                  dissections demonstrative of the relative anatomy of the
                  principal regions of the human body.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  The surface of the human body, Maclise argued, was like a map;
                  the surgeon was required to read the topography of the body,
                  seeing through the skin to the anatomy beneath. He called on
                  his surgical readers to assume an “expansive gaze” and engage
                  in a form of comparative anatomy—viewing human anatomy in

                <p>
                  The monumental undertaking of producing the images and text
                  for <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> was likely intended to establish
                  Maclise as an eminent anatomist and anatomical illustrator in
                  his own right. Nonetheless, it is tempting to imagine his
                  Royal Academician brother, Daniel, assisting with this large
                  artistic undertaking. The illustrations in
                  <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> certainly work to demonstrate the
                  artistic skill of their maker(s), featuring depictions of
                  ideal physical specimens: attractive, seemingly healthy men,
                  in their prime. Aside from their developed musculature, they
                  bear no evidence of hard labour, poverty, or illness—they look
                  more asleep than dead. On occasion, their poses are even made
                  to invoke classical statues such as the
                  <em>Belvedere Torso</em>, thereby elevating the atlas to the
                  status of “high” art.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite its artistic and scientific merits, Maclise’s
                  <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> has been overlooked largely in both
                  the art-historical and medical-historical literature.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  At best, it is briefly mentioned in histories of anatomical
                  illustration.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                  One possible explanation for this oversight is that Maclise’s
                  atlas is easily dismissed as too medical for art historians
                  and too artistic for medical historians. Additionally, it does
                  not fit seamlessly into traditional narratives about the
                  development of anatomical illustration. After all, Henry
                  Gray’s <em>Anatomy of the Human Body</em>, with its
                  modern-looking, pared down illustrations, was first published
                  in 1858—only seven years after the publication of the complete
                  first edition of <em>Surgical Anatomy</em>. It is difficult to
                  square Maclise’s large, elaborate, colourful engravings with
                  Henry Vandyke Carter’s starker productions. Therefore, it is
                  not surprising that <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> received a
                  lukewarm reception in the United Kingdom when it was first
                  published. The moment for these kinds of anatomical
                  productions in the British context, it seems, had passed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We often talk of canonical artists as being ahead or of their
                  time; with Maclise, it feels as though we are dealing with a
                  great talent who came a moment too late. Hence, in an effort
                  to raise Maclise and his work from obscurity, this One Object
                  feature brings together historians of art and historians of
                  medicine in what has proven to be an exciting exercise in
                  interdisciplinarity. A series of three short films featuring
                  Ludmilla Jordanova and William Schupbach in conversation in
                  the Wellcome Library focus on Maclise’s productions, the
                  contexts in which they were made, used, and collected, and the
                  materiality of the objects themselves. In his article,&nbsp;“Joseph
                  Maclise, Taylor &amp; Walton, and Publishing on Gower Street
                  in the 1840s”,&nbsp;Schupbach maps medical publishing and
                  publishers around Gower Street in Bloomsbury during the
                  nineteenth century. Anthea Callen, in “Bloodlines: Circulating
                  the Male Body Across Borders in Art and Anatomy 1780–1860”,
                  situates Maclise in the medical and artistic networks of
                  nineteenth-century Ireland, England, and France, in order to
                  demonstrate the impact on Maclise’s illustrations of a variety
                  of visual sources. Naomi Slipp reveals in her article, “‘It
                  Should Be On Every Surgeon’s Table’: The Reception and
                  Adoption of Joseph Maclise’s Surgical Anatomy (1851) in the
                  United States”, that Maclise’s <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> was
                  remarkably well received in the United States. Michael
                  Sappol’s richly illustrated article, “Mr Joseph Maclise and
                  the Epistemology of the Anatomical Closet”, offers a
                  provocative examination of the “queerness” of Maclise’s
                  illustrations, character, and relationships, and the palpable
                  homoeroticism of several of his illustrations*.*
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite the sanitised nature of many of Maclise’s
                  illustrations, it is clear that we are looking at dead bodies.
                  Hence, I encourage readers to proceed with care. The
                  substantial number of photographs that were taken of anatomy
                  theatres and dissecting rooms during the nineteenth century
                  offer vital clues to the use of illustrations of dissections,
                  such as those produced by Maclise.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                  These photographs, which can be difficult to look at,
                  invariably feature objects: skeletons, écorchés, casts of
                  classical statues and statuettes, and illustrations of
                  dissections hanging on the walls; they also sometimes include
                  people—dead and alive. While far from comprehensive,
                  photographs of British, American, and Australian anatomy
                  theatres are included here in an image gallery. Some of these
                  photographs are discussed by contributors to this One Object
                  feature; others are included to give a sense of the
                  environments in which dissections were performed and the kinds
                  of objects that were used for anatomical instruction during
                  the nineteenth and early twentieth century (<a href="#vaaatml-fig8">Figs. 8</a>–<a href="#vaaatml-fig18">18</a>). Looking at these
                  photographs, it is essential that we remain mindful of the
                  ethical concerns surrounding the public and private display of
                  images and sculptures of dead and anatomised bodies. As
                  several of the articles in this feature make clear, histories
                  of anatomical illustration and modelling are inevitably bound
                  up with the fraught issues of consent, exploitation,
                  voyeurism, and the status of the corpse.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, gaps remain for future scholars to fill in. Much is
                  still unknown about Maclise. The nature of his relationship
                  with his brother Daniel is commented on by&nbsp;all of the
                  contributors, but the biographical material is one sided;
                  Daniel’s life has been written, Joseph’s has not.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                  As a result, we are often forced to find Joseph in Daniel’s
                  biography. Above all, with very little to work with aside from
                  the images and texts produced by (white, male) doctors and
                  artists like Maclise, we continue—slowly—to piece together the
                  identities of the men, women, and children, who ended up on
                  the dissecting table against their will in an age before
                  consent was required to cut open dead bodies for the purpose
                  of “Anatomical Examination”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>

                  Art and anatomy in the nineteenth century were intimately
                  linked male-dominated professions, where hand and eye united.
                  These activities were key interconnected sites of male
                  bonding, of growing professional identity formation, and of
                  the construction of modern masculinity. For the Irish-born
                  Maclise brothers, Daniel and Joseph, the bonds were also
                  fraternal: brothers living and working together in London
                  throughout their lives with a shared passion for life drawing,
                  anatomy, and the human figure in pictorial representation.
                  Dissecting, in particular, the lithographic drawings of
                  surgeon-artist Joseph Maclise (1815–1880) in Richard Quain’s
                  <em>The Anatomy of the Arteries of the Human Body</em>
                  (1840–circa 1844) and his own <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> (1851,
                  1856, and 1859), this essay tracks the lifeblood of the
                  anatomical arts circulating around the networks of specialists
                  with whom Maclise was associated, from Cork and the capitals
                  of Scotland, England, and France, across the Atlantic to
                  Philadelphia and Boston. At a time when travel was far slower,
                  surgeons, artists, and printmakers travelled long distances in
                  search of greater learning, the flow returning to generate new
                  knowledges in its places of origin. Like the Grand Tour, these
                  journeys often lasted far longer than a passing tourist visit,
                  at times entailing months or years of professional study and
                  work—as in Joseph Maclise’s anatomy studies in Paris. The
                  anatomical work, and its representation in images and texts,
                  was thereby circulating in shared ideas, practices, teaching,
                  books, manuals, atlases, art, and crucially, given that the
                  (primarily) white male body was the “universal” body in
                  medical anatomy, in shared ways of seeing and constituting the
                  human (male) body.

                  Art, anatomy, and printing in the nineteenth century were
                  intimately linked, male-dominated professions, where hand and
                  eye unite. All three activities were key interconnected sites
                  of male bonding, of growing professional identity formation,
                  and of the construction of modern masculinity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
                  For the Irish-born Maclise brothers, Daniel and Joseph, these
                  bonds were also fraternal: brothers living and working
                  together throughout their lives with a shared passion for life
                  drawing, anatomy, and the human figure in pictorial
                  representation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
                  Where Daniel as a history painter gained fame and royal
                  patronage under the prince regent, executing monumental
                  commissions for the Houses of Parliament, little is known of
                  surgeon-anatomist Joseph.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
                  Here I argue that the difference between Joseph Maclise’s work
                  as an accomplished artist-anatomist and that of previous
                  anatomical illustrators is that he fused his dissection
                  drawings with his studies after living “life models”,
                  superimposing onto, <em>incorporating</em> these beautifully
                  “airbrushed” innards into the superbly drawn bodies of his
                  life figures: these are not cadavers, not those truly dead
                  corpses with muscles tensed in rigor mortis found in anatomy
                  dissection rooms (<a href="#acallen-fig2">Fig. 2</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>
                  Where in Vesalius or Valverde, blatantly deathly figures act
                  out <em>life</em> (albeit classically, mythologically inspired
                  and often as <em>memento mori</em>), Maclise’s very real,
                  athletic men perform <em>death</em>. Not only do his (almost
                  exclusively) male models hold themselves in ways impossible to
                  rope up or secure dead bodies, but also their flesh and muscle
                  retain the full vigour and synergy of life.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>

                  Dissecting the work of Joseph Maclise (1815–1880), this essay
                  tracks the life-blood of the anatomical arts circulating
                  around the networks of specialists with whom Maclise was
                  associated, from Cork and the capitals of Scotland, England,
                  and France, across the Atlantic to Philadelphia and
                  Boston.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
                  At a time when travel was of course far slower, anatomists,
                  surgeons, artists, and printmakers travelled long distances in
                  search of greater learning, the flow returning to generate new
                  knowledges in its places of origin. Like the Grand Tour, these
                  journeys often lasted far longer than a passing tourist visit,
                  at times entailing months or years of professional study and
                  work—as in Joseph Maclise’s anatomy <em>stage(s)</em> in
                  Paris. The anatomical work, and its representation in images
                  and texts, was thereby circulating in shared ideas, practices,
                  teaching, books, manuals, atlases, art, and crucially, given
                  that the (primarily) white male body was the “universal” body
                  in medical anatomy, in shared ways of seeing and constituting
                  the human (male) body. As we shall see, Maclise’s lithographs,
                  already unusual for the inclusion of Black men, are of such
                  high quality that “ethnic” variations of skin tone are
                  discernible even in this grey-scale medium. Although perhaps
                  equally studied in anatomy dissection rooms, the female body
                  was rare in anatomical prints, especially for teaching—and
                  used almost exclusively to display female <em>difference</em>:
                  woman’s generative organs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
                  Female bodies caused concern and breaches of propriety in the
                  male-student only dissection room.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By 1800, human (pathological and comparative) anatomy was both
                  a research science in its own right and the foundational study
                  not just for surgeons, but increasingly also for all serious
                  medical practitioners.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>
                  Yet far from being a forked road where art and science
                  irrevocably separated, this period in fact heralded an ever
                  deeper mutual dependence, especially in anatomy, physiology,
                  and nascent anthropology; this mutual dependence was further
                  entrenched with the advent of photography in 1839, followed by
                  radiographic and other imaging processes. Artists, too,
                  continued to study anatomical dissection to hone their
                  knowledge of the human body, gaining kudos from this
                  association; anatomy professors trained artists while
                  simultaneously relying on their representational skills to
                  communicate their own learning—and their professional prestige
                  in major portraits.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
                  Traditionally in Britain, physicians were university trained
                  (Oxford and Cambridge in England, Edinburgh in Scotland, and
                  Dublin in Ireland), as against surgeons whose more “craft”
                  associated training had remained closely allied to the private
                  anatomy schools, to the hospitals, and to apprenticeships or
                  “demonstratorships”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
                  Only once the Anglican stranglehold of the Oxbridge
                  universities had been loosened in England, and secular medical
                  schools like London’s University College had been founded (in
                  1826), did the expansion in anatomy teaching foster a
                  burgeoning market in textbooks—as well as in bodies for
                  dissection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
                  Edinburgh&nbsp;surgeon-anatomists John (1763–1820) and Charles
                  Bell's (1774–1842)&nbsp;quarto-sized publications with in-text
                  images were pragmatically designed for individual student use,
                  whereas the life-size lithographs in Maclise’s atlas (up to
                  about 64&nbsp;x&nbsp;50&nbsp;cm) for trainee surgeons were first released in
                  loose-leaf fascicules, whether for use in libraries and
                  lecture theatres, or pinned to the walls of anatomy schools,
                  hospital dissection rooms, or operating theatres—or indeed for
                  the specialist tastes of <em>cognoscenti</em> collectors.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>

                  Academy-trained professional artists, especially men like
                  Daniel Maclise, with ambitions to excel in the top echelons of
                  history painting, attended compulsory anatomy classes in the
                  art academies of Cork, London, and Paris. The Maclise brothers
                  were keen Europhiles with a particular passion for France:
                  Daniel made his first visit to Paris in 1830, and he and
                  Joseph are recorded there together in September 1844. After he
                  finished at University College in 1839, and perhaps again in
                  1844, Joseph Maclise continued his anatomy studies in Paris,
                  then not only world capital of art but also of Enlightenment
                  natural sciences and medical research; there he undertook
                  hundreds of anatomical dissections at Pierre-Nicolas Gerdy’s
                  (1797–1856) École d’Anatomie attached to the Hôpital de la
                  Pitié in the fifth arrondissement (<a href="#acallen-fig3">Fig. 3</a>). As Maclise explained in his own preface to
                  <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> (1851), the “illustrations made by
                  myself from my own dissections” were “first planned at London
                  University College”, presumably while still a student there,
                  and “afterwards realised at the École Pratique, and School of
                  Anatomy a few years since”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
                  He would have left University College already briefed on his
                  commission for Richard Quain’s
                  <em>Anatomy of the Arteries</em> since the first plates
                  appeared late in 1840, and he also did the groundwork in Paris
                  for his own subsequent publications.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>
                  For the journeyman anatomist or trainee surgeon at this time,
                  the Hôpital de la Pitié had two distinct advantages. First,
                  ready access to corpses: it was the Paris hospital-asylum for
                  the poor and destitute, and hence furnished an endless supply
                  of unclaimed bodies for dissection and, being located next to
                  Sainte-Pélagie prison, it also had access to the corpses of
                  criminals.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>
                  Second, its chief anatomist-surgeon, Gerdy, was one of the
                  most interesting and radical anatomists of his era: his
                  work—and networks—were undoubtedly a key formative influence
                  on Joseph Maclise.

                <p>
                  Underpinning my discussion in this essay is the idea of a
                  disinterested “objective” scientific gaze (Foucault’s
                  “controlling” medical gaze), as distinct from its “subjective”
                  counterpart, the artist’s gaze. Yet why so superior, different
                  or mutually exclusive?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>
                  These apparently distinct views are in fact shared, not least
                  because they were jointly formed. Positioning the gaze as
                  essentially embodied, subjective—as classed, racialised,
                  gendered, sexed, socio-historically, and geographically
                  specific—these two purportedly distinct
                  visualities—science/art, “objective/subjective”—converge here
                  in, and on, a single principal “subject”: at once the desiring
                  male artist-anatomist and the desirable male (anatomical)
                  body. In anatomical representation, there is often an
                  obsessional, narcissistic scrutiny of the male body, whether
                  in all its beauty or in all its sordid abjection; its
                  circulation in this private scientific world authorised an
                  entirely legitimate desiring gaze, a gaze seeking
                  knowledge—but also pleasure and pain. The objective scientific
                  gaze, like the artist’s gaze, is simultaneously a private
                  libidinous gaze. So multiple lines of sight, visual positions,
                  converge and enmesh on a single corpus: subjective, objective,
                  libidinous, <em>embodied</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Given the multi-sensory nature of artistic and medical
                  practice alike, my discussion highlights their shared reliance
                  on the senses of sight and touch.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>
                  In medical research of the period, especially in diagnostics,
                  the two senses are closely aligned.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup>
                  Imagine the intimate marriage of these senses necessary for
                  brilliant French <em>médécin-philosophe</em> and pathological
                  anatomist Xavier Bichat (1771–1802) to accomplish his
                  remarkable anatomical taxonomy of human tissues and membranes,
                  entirely without the visual aid of a microscope.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">22</a></sup>
                  John and Charles Bell&nbsp;also emphasised the importance of touch
                  as well as vision, the latter writing treatises on both the
                  eye and the hand; as we shall see, Joseph Maclise’s Parisian
                  mentor Gerdy, too, researched the sense of touch.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">23</a></sup>
                  Seen in comparison to the work of contemporaries, or indeed
                  almost any other anatomist, Maclise’s lithographic anatomies
                  are strikingly erotic. Examining them here in fine-grained
                  detail enables an exploration of the roles of sight and touch
                  in the generation of an embodied libidinous gaze in art and
                  anatomy alike.

                <p>
                  Since the vast majority of bodies available for dissection
                  belonged to the poor and destitute, the abject and powerless,
                  anatomy was fundamentally an issue of class, of who held the
                  power and who ended up on the slab. Anatomy schools sprang up
                  conveniently alongside hospitals or asylums for the poor, or
                  close to prisons. Xavier Bichat benefited, too, from the
                  proliferation of available corpses during the Reign of Terror
                  (1793–1794); even in his last year, he is reputed to have
                  opened upwards of 600 bodies.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">24</a></sup>
                  Ironically, many such guillotined specimens would also have
                  had the advantage of being young, healthy, and fit, albeit
                  headless. Surgeon-anatomist Jean-Joseph Sue
                  <em>fils</em> (1760–1830) and artist-surgeon Jean-Galbert
                  Salvage (1772–1813) both profited too from the invaluable
                  experience of war surgery on the battlefield—as did Charles
                  Bell—and from access to dead soldiers or duellists for
                  dissection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">25</a></sup>
                  Salvage’s work entered the Académie Royale de Peinture et de
                  Sculpture collections, as did his
                  <em>Anatomie du Gladiateur</em> (1812), which other art
                  academies also acquired, while in 1789 Sue
                  <em>fils</em> himself inherited the chair of anatomy there
                  from his father.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">26</a></sup>
                  A typical medical traveller in search of knowledge, Sue
                  <em>fils</em> completed his MD in 1783 at the Royal College of
                  Physicians in Edinburgh, overlapping there with John Bell, who
                  had become a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1780.
                  Both Sue <em>fils</em>, who wrote on the nature and experience
                  of death by guillotine, and Bichat were among many anatomists
                  researching key scientific questions of life and death, which
                  were central preoccupations during this period and which
                  pertain to my discussion of Joseph Maclise. Although Bichat’s
                  research was unknown outside Paris when he died at the early
                  age of thirty, by the 1840s, “his system of histology and
                  pathological anatomy had taken both the French and English
                  medical worlds by storm”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">27</a></sup>
                  And just as from this period onwards in France corporal
                  punishment and the scaffold were forbidden as public
                  spectacles, so too did the carnivalesque public dissections in
                  the European theatres of anatomy cease. This “discipline”,
                  entering the professional realms of institutional science, was
                  now hidden from the public gaze.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">28</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Between the 1820s and the 1860s, the overarching period
                  covering Joseph Maclise’s publications, there were dramatic
                  changes in the provision of anatomy teaching for medical
                  students, aided by the 1832 Anatomy Act in Britain permitting
                  the release of unclaimed bodies to science. The old private
                  anatomy schools closed down or combined with the newly
                  proliferating university and hospital medical schools which
                  took over and regulated their role.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">29</a></sup>
                  Thus Charles Bell, for example, who in 1811 had moved his
                  anatomical practice from his home into William Hunter’s
                  (1718–1783) old Great Windmill Street School of Anatomy,
                  became the first professor of anatomy and surgery at the
                  London College of Surgeons in Lincoln’s Inn Fields in 1824. In
                  1829, the Great Windmill Street School of Anatomy was
                  incorporated into the new (Anglican) King’s College medical
                  school established to counter the new reformist London
                  University College, to which Bell was appointed professor of
                  surgery in that same year.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">30</a></sup>

                <h3>Edinburgh</h3>
                <p>
                  At a moment in the late eighteenth century when modern
                  medicine began its inexorable rise, John Bell’s work produced
                  the first modern surgical anatomy. He elaborated not simply
                  anatomists’ growing knowledge of the human body, its norms,
                  and pathologies, but also offered insight into its surgical
                  treatment.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">31</a></sup>
                  His brother Charles added further volumes at the turn of the
                  century and in the years immediately following.

                <p>
                  Although published in the relatively small octavo, John Bell’s
                  plates were uncompromisingly blunt: rendered with an almost
                  aggressive crudity, a Rembrandtesque chiaroscuro adds
                  atmospheric gloom to his anti-aesthetic pictorial
                  “naturalism”. Aiming, he states in the preface to his 1794
                  <em>Engravings Explaining the Anatomy of the Bones, Muscles and
                    Joints</em>, at the “useful” (for the student) rather than the
                  “beautiful”,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">32</a></sup>
                  Bell explains:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    I have drawn my plates with my own hand. I have engraved
                    some of these plates, and etched almost the whole of them:
                    Which I mention only to show, that they have their chance of
                    being correct in the anatomy … and whatever they may have
                    lost in elegance, they have gained … in truth and
                    accuracy.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">33</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  His “gothic horror” anatomical plates figured the violence of
                  dissection. Unmistakably dead, his corpses and body parts lie
                  abruptly dumped on tables or strung up with gallows-style
                  ropes, set in awkwardly angled compositions within dingy
                  interiors closed off from light and air (<a href="#acallen-fig4">Fig. 4</a>). Here, we are told, is the natural home of dissection: in
                  mean, ill-lit backrooms or dank basements, like the dark
                  underground chambers of Henri Gervex’s (1852–1929) oil study

                  All outward appearance of respect for the dead that might be
                  politely parsed in a classical idiom is in Bell sacrificed to
                  the sceptic’s plain-speaking eye. Thus, Bell’s etchings,
                  deeply blackened with the oily printing ink, render the
                  dissection slab a terrifying scene of back-street butchery,
                  torture, and human sacrifice, anticipating by over twenty
                  years literary works like Mary Shelley’s (1797–1851)
                  <em>Frankenstein</em> (1818) and the later
                  anatomist-turned-author Eugène Sue’s (1804–1857, son of Sue
                  <em>fils</em>) <em>Les Mystères de Paris</em> (1830).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">35</a></sup>
                  John Bell’s prints, then, are unmediated by conventional
                  “taste” or by examples drawn from classical Greek or Roman
                  models, deliberately eschewing the cultivated mannerisms that
                  made ideal anatomies socially acceptable. Effectively the
                  founder of applied surgical anatomy and Scotland’s most
                  successful surgeon in his time, John Bell flaunted his
                  materialist expertise in the dissecting room in the face of
                  his rivals, the Edinburgh University and Edinburgh Royal
                  Hospital medical elite: not for Bell the niceties of the
                  Edinburgh drawing room.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">36</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Arguing as powerfully for plainness of words as for directness
                  of images, John Bell decried professional anatomists’
                  self-defeating obscurantism which, especially in language,
                  alienated young would-be practitioners in the field.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">37</a></sup>
                  Analysing a range of historical illustrations widely deployed
                  or imitated, from Vesalius (1514–1564) on, Bell described the
                  continual struggle between painter and anatomist—the “one
                  striving for elegance of form, the other for accuracy of
                  representation”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">38</a></sup>
                  Derived merely from the imagination of the painter, he noted,
                  such illustrations show “sturdy and active figures, with a
                  ludicrous contrast of furious countenances, and active limbs,
                  combined with ragged muscles, and naked bones, and dissected
                  bowels, which they are busily employed in supporting,
                  forsooth, or demonstrating with their hands.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">39</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was, Bell argued (referring to Albinus), like a “statue
                  anatomised”, where “all the irregularities of substance, all
                  the gradations of bones, ligaments, tendon, and flesh, are
                  rounded down with studied smoothness; it is a figure that can
                  never compare with the body as it lies before him for
                  dissection”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">40</a></sup>
                  Instead of this “vitious [<em>sic</em>] practice” images
                  illustrating anatomy texts should be “useful” rather than
                  “elegant” and “tasteful”, presented, Bell argued, only as they
                  appear on the dissecting table during the procedures, notably
                  with “enough of the general figure … kept there to explain the
                  posture of the parts”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">41</a></sup>
                  This could only be achieved, we understand, by a singular
                  talent combining both the artistic and scientific—like his own
                  and that of his younger brother Charles, and, of course,
                  Joseph Maclise. Following John Bell, Maclise was a strict
                  adherent to evidential science; yet, in Maclise’s atlas-size
                  plates, representation of the “general figure” came almost to
                  dominate over the dissection itself, and death succumbed to
                  life.

                <p>
                  Beginning his art studies as a youth in Cork, copying
                  classical casts in Crawford Art Gallery from the newly
                  acquired collection cast by Antonio Canova, from 1828, Daniel
                  Maclise continued his art studies at the Royal Academy in
                  London.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">43</a></sup>
                  Joseph Maclise may also have drawn from these casts and would
                  certainly have known them. Daniel began his anatomy studies
                  too in Cork, with the influential military surgeon, anatomist,
                  and art enthusiast John Woodroffe (1788–1859), attending his
                  lectures over a number of years and devoting “many winters” to
                  dissection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">44</a></sup>
                  The Cork network was highly influential within London circles
                  too; Richard Quain (1800–1887) may well have studied under
                  Woodroffe, who probably taught Joseph Maclise, too. Woodroffe,
                  in turn, commended Maclise to Quain at University College in
                  London to continue his studies, and where in 1832 Quain was
                  appointed professor of descriptive anatomy.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">45</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the preface to his
                  <em>Anatomy of the Arteries of the Human Body</em> (1840–circa
                  1844), Richard Quain described his illustrator Joseph Maclise
                  as “my former pupil”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">46</a></sup>
                  Maclise gained his licentiate at University College in 1839
                  and by the date of Quain’s publication was working “at the
                  duties of his profession”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">47</a></sup>
                  Joseph himself named his teachers at University College as
                  Robert Liston (1794–1847) and Samuel Cooper (1780–1848); it
                  was to them (as well as his fellow students), rather than
                  Quain, that Maclise dedicated his
                  <em>Surgical Anatomy</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">48</a></sup>
                  Samuel Cooper gave Joseph Maclise the intellectual and
                  discursive basis for his publishing interests, while Robert
                  Liston taught him the incisive surgical dexterity which,
                  thanks to Joseph’s equal dexterity with both scalpel and
                  pencil, provided the perfect combination for his anatomical
                  publications. Like his brother Daniel, Joseph Maclise was a
                  superb draughtsman of the human body; indeed, Joseph was
                  perhaps the greater of the two, with his more instinctive feel
                  for composition and bold treatment, but with the same sharp
                  eye for detail. Joseph’s figures are more powerfully emotive
                  than those of Daniel—who could not resist a trivialising
                  anecdotalism in the gestures and expressions of his figures,
                  even when making grand history paintings like
                  <em>The Death of Nelson</em> or <em>Waterloo</em> (1858–1864)
                  (<a href="#acallen-fig6">Fig. 6</a>, see also

                <p>
                  The urban geographies of London and Paris were highly
                  significant to the Maclise brothers, who are known to have
                  lived together throughout their lives, with sister Isabella as
                  their housekeeper.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">49</a></sup>
                  Daniel Maclise arrived in London in 1827 aged twenty-one,
                  enrolling at the Royal Academy the following year. His brother
                  followed him to London, perhaps at the of age twenty-two in
                  1837, the year Daniel took up residence in 14 Russell Place
                  (<a href="#acallen-fig7">Fig. 7</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">50</a></sup>
                  It was here that Daniel must have had his studio, and where
                  doubtless the brothers worked side by side drawing together
                  from the muscular male life models that are characteristic in
                  the oeuvre of both. Eventually, this would also be the address
                  of Joseph’s surgical practice.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">51</a></sup>
                  Yet, since he qualified in 1839, it is more likely Joseph
                  arrived in London considerably earlier when, from 1831 to
                  1837, Daniel lived just a few doors south at 63 Charlotte
                  Street.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">52</a></sup>
                  An area of good houses, constructed only thirty years
                  previously, Fitzrovia was renowned for its artists as well as
                  the artists’ trades: John Constable (a tutor of Daniel Maclise
                  at the RA) lived at 78 Charlotte Street from 1822–1837,
                  finishing <em>The Lock</em>, <em>Salisbury Cathedral</em>, and

                  Right across the street from the Maclises, at 64 Charlotte
                  Street, lived and worked the famous lithographic printers that
                  Joseph chose for his <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> plates: Michael
                  and Nicolas Hanhart, who came to London in the 1820s. They
                  were from the same Mulhouse/Paris stable as Godefroy Engelmann
                  (1788–1839) and Jeremiah Graf, “Printers to Her Majesty”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54">54</a></sup>
                  Indeed, in this early period, lithographers were an even more
                  interconnected fraternity than artists or anatomists. Graf was
                  the lithographer selected by Quain to print Maclise’s
                  illustrations to his&nbsp;<em>Anatomy of the Arteries of the Human Body</em>
                  in 1840–circa 1844. Jeremiah Graf and Godefroy’s nephew
                  Auguste Engelmann had established a lithography business in
                  London in 1826, joined there from Paris by Michael Hanhart in
                  1828 as an assistant, then manager. In 1830, M. &amp; N.
                  Hanhart established their own lithographic business in
                  Charlotte Street, when the Engelmann London branch (Engelmann,
                  Graf &amp; Coindet) failed. Jeremiah Graf too, apparently with
                  his brother Charles, set up his own business nearby that same
                  year, first at 14 Newman Street (also Fitzrovia) and, by 1838,
                  at 16 Castle Street (now Eastcastle Street), just off
                  Charlotte Street.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55">55</a></sup>
                  The proximity of both Graf and M. &amp; N. Hanhart to the
                  Maclise residence meant that not only were they familiars but,
                  in the case of Hanhart, Joseph had merely to cross the street
                  to work on his stones at the printers’ (where studios with
                  stones were made available) or, as was also customary at this
                  period, stones for artists’ to work on were delivered to their
                  studios.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56">56</a></sup>
                  Conveniently too, for both Maclise brothers, the firm of
                  Winsor &amp; Newton, artists’ colourmen, was established in
                  1832 just down from Charlotte Street at 38 Rathbone Place.
                  George Rowney Colourmen had begun around the corner at 10 and
                  11 Percy Street in 1783; by the 1850s, they had their retail
                  outlet at 51 Rathbone Place, with wholesale at 10 Percy

                <h3>Paris</h3>
                <p>
                  The precise dates of Joseph Maclise’s anatomy studies in Paris
                  are uncertain. He most likely worked there for a couple of
                  years immediately after qualifying at London University
                  College in 1839, but he was certainly back in Paris for an
                  extended period in 1844. By summer 1844, Maclise’s
                  lithographic plates for Quain’s
                  <em>The Anatomy of the Arteries of the Human Body</em> would
                  have been more or less completed, and some of these provided
                  the backbone for his own <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> (1851).
                  Daniel Maclise had first visited the city while still a Royal
                  Academy student, just after the “Three Glorious Days” of the
                  July Revolution in France in 1830. His return visit for a
                  month in 1844 confirms Joseph was already in Paris and perhaps
                  based again at the École d’Anatomie at L’Hôpital de la
                  Pitié.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58">58</a></sup>
                  It was probably late August when Daniel joined “Joe”, who was
                  living in student lodgings at Hôtel Corneille, rue Corneille,
                  in the Luxembourg area centrally located between the Sorbonne
                  and the Écoles de Médecine and Beaux-Arts (see
                  <a href="#acallen-fig3">Fig. 3</a>). The hotel served as a
                  residence, as he reported, “… principally occupied by students
                  of every grade and style, and of every profession—clerical,
                  law-yal [<em>sic</em>], medical, artistical”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59">59</a></sup>
                  Daniel had already been three weeks in Paris when he wrote
                  this, and his description illuminates Joseph Maclise’s
                  circumstances while working in Paris:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    I am <em>au quatrième</em> in a small room in the … hotel,
                    my bed in a recess at one end, and the casement opening from
                    ceiling to floor at the other. It commands a view of the
                    Odéon Theatre, which is on the opposite side of the narrow
                    street … On the left, I can see the principal dome of the
                    Palace of the Luxembourg, and can be in the Gallery in 2½
                    minutes from my bedroom. I have a little bed, a little
                    chair, a little chest of drawers, a big looking glass, a
                    large washing-basin, jug, and water-bottle; the room is
                    surrounded by shelves for books, the floor is polished oak,
                    laid down in a pattern, and this is, I believe, the exact
                    model of all the rooms in the house … Each floor is served
                    by a <em>garçon</em>, who is every man’s factotum; he makes
                    the bed, cleans the boots, brushes the clothes, stitches on
                    buttons, and does everything that the necessities of fifty
                    men require. … I fortunately got into the very next room to
                    Joe, which was unoccupied, the tenant having just left the
                    day before …<br>
                    <br>
                    I breakfast and dine, and do all that I have to do, from
                    home. I am out from nine in the morning; I am choke-full up
                    to my eyes in pictures; I never saw so much in all my life
                    put together; it has taken me from ten in the morning till
                    four in the afternoon, for three days together, constantly
                    walking, to see the miles of canvas in Versailles.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60">60</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  In his descriptions of the sites and galleries he visited, and
                  of the many notable London friends (mainly artistic) he met,
                  who were also in Paris on tour, Daniel scarcely mentions his
                  brother.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61">61</a></sup>
                  Nevertheless, since Joseph was known to frequent the galleries
                  and museums, it is likely that for much of Daniel’s stay they
                  joined forces. It is clear it was quite customary to drop into
                  the studios of artists one admired, or who were
                  friends/associates; presumably Joseph also engaged in this
                  practice—and in visits to lithographers like Engelmann
                  associated with his London printers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Together in Paris, Daniel and Joseph Maclise undoubtedly
                  visited the artworks both greatly admired, including the
                  Louvre’s Napoleonic paintings by Antoine-Jean Gros (1771–1835)
                  and Paul Delaroche’s (1797–1856)
                  <em>Execution of Lady Jane Grey</em> (1833), plus his recently
                  completed
                  <em>L’Hémicycle du Palais des Beaux-Arts</em> (1837–1841) at
                  the Palais des Beaux-Arts, which Daniel claimed to visit
                  almost daily.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn62" id="fnref62">62</a></sup>
                  The Maclises both admired Théodore Gericault’s (1791–1824)
                  monumental <em>Raft of the Medusa</em> (1819), which entered
                  the Louvre in 1824, soon after the artist’s early death (<a href="#acallen-fig7">Fig. 7</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn63" id="fnref63">63</a></sup>
                  However, according to Nicolas-Sebastien Maillot’s 1831
                  painting,
                  <em>Raft of the Medusa Shown in Salon Carré of the Louvre</em>, the huge canvas was then hung too high for close study (<a href="#acallen-fig8">Fig.&nbsp;8</a>). In his monumental history painting,
                  <em>The Meeting of Wellington and Blücher after Waterloo</em>
                  (1861), Daniel follows Gros’ heroic Napoleonic dramas like the
                  <em>Retreat from Moscow</em> in his own treatment of the
                  foreground dead (<a href="#acallen-fig9">Fig.&nbsp;9</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn64" id="fnref64">64</a></sup>
                  Particular poses in
                  <em>The Meeting of Wellington and Blücher after Waterloo</em>
                  owe a clear debt too, to Gericault’s
                  <em>Raft of the Medusa</em>: two sprawled soldiers (far left
                  and right) in eye-catching white breeches, are direct quotes,
                  in reverse, of the foreground right corpse posed by Delacroix
                  for Gericault’s painting. Likewise, the beautifully modelled
                  thighs and the use of eroticising drapery in this
                  Gericault/Delacroix nude find powerful echoes in Joseph’s
                  drawings, for example, Plate 16 of
                  <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> (1851) (<a href="#acallen-fig10">Fig.&nbsp;10</a>), with its equally sumptuous thighs; here, the cursorily
                  suggested white drapery nevertheless performs a key narrative
                  function: akin to a lifted shirt, it serves a seductive,
                  revelatory role more associated with female nudes, drawing the
                  eye to the genitals, rather than (as in the Gericault)
                  covering them up. This device had been yet more provocatively
                  deployed by Maclise in his abdomen dissection for Quain (circa
                  1844, Plate 51) (<a href="#acallen-fig11">Fig. 11</a>).
                  Maclise’s drapery is remarkably pristine compared to the
                  filthy rags we sense in John Bell’s prints—or yet the
                  blood-soaked cloth draped across the central nude in
                  Delacroix’s <em>Massacre at Chios</em> (1824), also in the
                  Louvre (<a href="#acallen-fig12">Fig.&nbsp;12</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn65" id="fnref65">65</a></sup>
                  Delacroix’s modern Greek god, his languidly beautiful body and
                  rich olive skin, echoed by Joseph Maclise in his Plate 51 for
                  Quain, lies dying in a position commonly used when starting
                  dissection: even closer is the pose of the corpse, far left,
                  in Gericault’s <em>Raft of the Medusa</em>.

                  In addition to the painting’s material presence on view in
                  Paris, several prints after Gericault’s
                  <em>Raft of the Medusa</em> were circulating in London from
                  the time of Gericault and his friend Nicolas Toussaint
                  Charlet’s (1792–1845) British tour of the painting during
                  April 1820–December 1821; Charlet produced a first, somewhat
                  woodcut-like lithograph in 1820, which was published at least
                  twice (in 1820 and 1823).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn66" id="fnref66">66</a></sup>
                  Often attributed to Gericault, Charlet was in fact its
                  principal author, and since Charlet himself became a renowned
                  lithographic printmaker, their work together in London
                  exploiting the medium is no surprise.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn67" id="fnref67">67</a></sup>
                  Gericault was one of the first major artists, in 1817, to
                  experiment with lithography as an artistic rather than a
                  purely reproductive medium, rapidly becoming an adept—as did
                  Delacroix. The medium’s immediacy, precision, and versatility
                  stemmed from the directness of the artist’s drawn chalk mark
                  on the prepared stone surface.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn68" id="fnref68">68</a></sup>
                  Although obviously reversed, the resulting print was an exact
                  replica of the drawing retaining its original qualities of
                  draughtsmanship and personal “touch”: a reproducible drawing.
                  It could be fine and delicate like silverpoint, or rich with
                  deep tone and <em>sfumato</em>. Since artists themselves could
                  draw directly on the stone, the process could eliminate the
                  intermediary craftsman or designer; intaglio methods, however,
                  required the help (as in the case of John Bell) or full
                  intervention of a skilled craftsman-artisan, who engraved the
                  drawing onto the copper plate. Lithographic prints were also
                  therefore cheaper as well as almost endlessly repeatable.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn69" id="fnref69">69</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, Charlet’s choice of a linear rather than a tonal
                  print after Gericault’s <em>Raft of the Medusa</em> meant it
                  lost all the chiaroscuresque drama and painterliness of the
                  original. Much closer in painterly feel was the print made for
                  the mass market by British printmaker, Samuel William Reynolds
                  (1773–1835) (<a href="#acallen-fig14">Fig.&nbsp;14</a>). His
                  mezzotint (circa 1829) was undoubtedly made in Paris, since it
                  was printed by F. Chardon, 30 rue Hautefeuille (just off
                  Boulevard St Germain between Boulevard St Michel and Place de
                  l’Odéon), and not long after Gericault’s painting entered the
                  Louvre. Also a friend of Charlet, and probably encouraged by
                  him, Reynolds often visited Paris and was certainly there in
                  the later 1820s; he was a painter and printmaker whose work
                  was more widely appreciated on the Continent than in Britain
                  and he regularly exhibited at the Paris Salon.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn70" id="fnref70">70</a></sup>
                  Reynolds’ mezzotint of the <em>Raft of the Medusa</em> meant
                  the painting that proved so popular in Britain was already
                  available in print and circulating in Paris and London by
                  1829; Daniel could have acquired a copy in Paris in 1830.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn71" id="fnref71">71</a></sup>

                  Still more telling are the networks in Paris that Joseph
                  Maclise accessed through Pierre-Nicolas Gerdy and his École
                  d’Anatomie. Like Maclise, Gerdy was deeply committed to
                  sensory evidence and reason in the science of anatomy, first
                  publishing his ideas in a pamphlet in 1844.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn72" id="fnref72">72</a></sup>
                  Thus, during the likely period of Maclise’s
                  <em>stage</em> there, Gerdy was researching touch and skin
                  sensation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn73" id="fnref73">73</a></sup>
                  Throughout the 1820s, he welcomed artists as well as medics at
                  the École d’Anatomie, running courses in which a key feature
                  for all students was work from the “living figure”, which he
                  deemed crucial to a real understanding of human anatomy. Gerdy
                  advertised his dedicated
                  <em>Cours d’anatomie appliquée à la peinture et à la
                    sculpture</em>
                  in 1827 and, in 1829, published his atlas,
                  <em>Anatomie des peintres</em>, with three lithographic
                  figures posed in conventional front, back, and side views;
                  separate linear key plates avoided complex key letters marring
                  his figures (<a href="#acallen-fig15">Figs. 15</a>–<a href="#acallen-fig17">17</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn74" id="fnref74">74</a></sup>
                  Both publications coincided with Gerdy’s bid for the chair of
                  anatomy at the École des Beaux-Arts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn75" id="fnref75">75</a></sup>
                  Many students from the Beaux-Arts preferred his teaching to
                  that of ageing incumbent Professor Jean-Joseph Sue
                  (1760–1830), whose classes they deserted in droves; Gerdy was
                  young, exciting, and interdisciplinary. Significantly, not
                  only did he teach from the live model but also from paintings
                  and sculpture, closing his curriculum with “considérations
                  historiques et bibliographiques sur l’anatomie, les
                  beaux-arts, et par des promenades anatomiques dans les jardins
                  et les musées publics, pour y analyser les reliefs sensibles
                  sur les statues et les tableaux”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn76" id="fnref76">76</a></sup>
                  He was (in)famous for his student tours of the Louvre,
                  critiquing artists’ anatomical knowledge in great works of
                  art. Gerdy’s emphasis on the living body in the actual and
                  pictorial underpinned all his teaching, although in his
                  treatises he (like Bichat) placed great emphasis on weighty
                  and at times impenetrable textual description. Even his
                  innovative classes, founded on the study of surface anatomy,
                  entailed obsessive description of every curve, bump, and
                  crevice of the human body (see
                  <a href="#acallen-fig15">Fig.&nbsp;15</a>). His students clearly
                  loved him: there were riots and two years of strikes at the
                  École des Beaux-Arts when, in 1830, Gerdy was passed over for
                  the chair, ostensibly on the grounds of his youth.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn77" id="fnref77">77</a></sup>

                  Before Gericault’s untimely death, he too probably worked with
                  Gerdy and, through him, may have had access to the corpses and
                  body parts he studied in his studio while working on the
                  <em>Raft of the Medusa</em>. Gerdy had links too with Gros,
                  whose students at the École des Beaux-Arts also studied with
                  Gerdy: under Gros, Maximilien-Félix Demesse (1806–18??)
                  competed unsuccessfully four times for the Prix de Rome, in
                  1827–1830.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn78" id="fnref78">78</a></sup>
                  Demesse provided the surface anatomy drawings for Gerdy’s
                  lithographic illustrations to his
                  <em>Anatomie des peintres</em>: he even redeployed this same
                  frontal figure for the protagonist Méléagre in his concour
                  <em>esquisse</em> for the Rome Prize in 1830 (<a href="#acallen-fig18">Fig.&nbsp;18</a>). His master Gros’ own early life studies, dynamic and
                  muscular (<a href="#acallen-fig19">Fig. 19</a>), make a
                  telling comparison too with the models of Maclise (see
                  <a href="#acallen-fig16">Fig.&nbsp;16</a>). While the overall
                  muscular athleticism is comparable, Maclise gives his figures
                  an extraordinary, extrovert vitality, openly disporting
                  themselves as if to a complicit viewer. Notable, too, is Gros’
                  academic treatment of the genitals, reduced to a shrunken,
                  abstracted pouch; the contrast reveals just how daringly
                  explicit were those of Maclise, even given the rationale of
                  their medical context. While working in Paris, Joseph Maclise
                  could well have attended Gros’ studio to pursue his life
                  drawing, or equally the open Académie Suisse life studio
                  frequented by all the great artists of the period, which was
                  located on Île de la Cité, just across the Pont Saint-Michel
                  on the Quai des Orfèvres (see
                  <a href="#acallen-fig3">Fig. 3</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn79" id="fnref79">79</a></sup>
                  Demesse’s life drawings for Gerdy were printed by lithographer
                  Pierre Langlumé (1790–18??), who exhibited at the Paris Salon
                  in 1822 and 1824, and whose printing workshop was conveniently
                  located at 6 rue de l’Abbaye, between the École des Beaux-Arts
                  and the École de Médecine.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn80" id="fnref80">80</a></sup>
                  Through Gerdy, Joseph Maclise likely met Demesse and Gros,
                  and, while in Paris, Maclise himself may have practised
                  lithography, perhaps at Langlumé’s (then owned by Bénard), or
                  with Jean Engelmann—son of Godefroy, an associate of Maclise’s
                  London printers Graf and the Hanharts—perhaps alongside the
                  renowned Nicolas-Henri Jacob (1782–1871), who lived next door
                  to Langlumé/Bénard, at 4 rue de l’Abbaye.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn81" id="fnref81">81</a></sup>
                  Trained under Jacques-Louis David and professor of drawing at
                  the École nationale vétérinaire d’Alfort (1818–1830), Jacob
                  was artist-lithographer to the renowned anatomist
                  Jean-Baptiste-Marc Bourgery (1797–1849), whose magisterial
                  <em>Traité complet de l’anatomie de l’homme</em> (1831–1854),
                  which Joseph would have known, ran to fourteen volumes,
                  including eight of plates, with over 700 illustrations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn82" id="fnref82">82</a></sup>
                  Early on, Jacob had demonstrated the new medium in practice in
                  his 1819 lithograph, <em>The Genius of Lithography</em>: his
                  1831 frontispiece for Bourgery flaunted his Davidian
                  credentials and penchant for male muscle (<a href="#acallen-fig20">Fig. 20</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn83" id="fnref83">83</a></sup>

                <p>
                  A key characteristic of all exemplary dissection
                  <em>écorchés</em> (cast from flayed corpses) on display in
                  anatomy schools was their muscular fitness: in life, they were
                  exclusively well-built soldiers, duellists, pugilists. So for
                  artistic anatomists like Joseph Maclise, even in death, high
                  manly ideals prevailed. Indeed, I contend that the figures in
                  Maclise’s anatomies actually were live models: men drawn from
                  life and probably in the studio alongside Daniel—the latter
                  preparatory to his grand historical battle scenes full of
                  military men, the former his “ideal” guardsmen stripped off in
                  the life room and transformed on the lithographic stone into
                  living anatomical specimens.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn86" id="fnref86">86</a></sup>
                  They are designed, as Joseph stated, “to indicate the interior
                  through the superficies, and thereby illustrate
                  <em>the whole living body</em> which concerns surgery”, which
                  was precisely Gerdy’s philosophy in teaching anatomy to
                  artists and surgeons alike.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn87" id="fnref87">87</a></sup>
                  Rather than making complete and finished drawings after his
                  dissected bodies for his lithographic figures, or indeed
                  drawing them directly on stone in the anatomy room, Maclise
                  must first have made detailed preparatory drawings just of the
                  dissected parts, and later transposed these, incorporating
                  them onto/into his figures drawn in the studio from life.
                  Joseph may have made drawings from the life model leaving
                  blank spaces ready to receive the dissected details to scale,
                  or possibly he made composites: scaled dissection drawings
                  pasted over a ready-drawn figure, which he would then redraw
                  complete onto stone.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn88" id="fnref88">88</a></sup>
                  No studies or life drawings on paper seem to survive which
                  could elucidate his method, and nor do there seem to be extant
                  life drawings of Daniel for comparison; the latter’s
                  full-scale cartoons that include semi-naked male figures are
                  the closest one gets to the latter’s method.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn89" id="fnref89">89</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Comparing work by other British contemporaries, for example,
                  William Fairland’s lithographs after J. Walsh’s drawings
                  (1837), while powerfully emotive, lack the taut anatomical
                  precision and skilled figure drawing of Maclise.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn90" id="fnref90">90</a></sup>
                  This is partly the result of a less coherent light source than
                  is customary in Maclise, but also their romantic figure of a
                  young male, appears decontextualised, a cut-out floating in
                  the middle of the sheet (<a href="#acallen-fig21">Fig. 21</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn91" id="fnref91">91</a></sup>
                  Similar figures by Maclise, like John Bell’s (see
                  <a href="#acallen-fig4">Fig. 4</a>), inhabit “real” space: a
                  table, or a surface with objects, drapery, the outline of a
                  chair all evoke an inhabited spatial setting. Nevertheless,
                  the richly sensual chiaroscuro in Walsh’s anatomical figures,
                  almost closer in appearance to mezzotint, are a probable
                  influence on Maclise’s lithographs, most notably in his own
                  <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> of 1851. Walsh’s drawing
                  romanticises its subject, a muscular and healthy young beauty
                  with a glorious sweep of curly hair stylishly coiffed as if
                  “in life”, his eyelids simply lowered at rest. Light and shade
                  in Maclise’s lithographs are more closely observed: his
                  directional light source produces greater formal, and hence
                  representational, coherence than does Walsh’s more
                  “abstracted” light, that merely catches the corporeal
                  prominences. There was something of this, however, in
                  Maclise’s first lithographs for Quain (<a href="#acallen-fig22">Fig.&nbsp;22</a>). Walsh depicts a youth’s head on a man’s body; the
                  sumptuous tonalities and modelling have all the romantic
                  mystery of a Gericault <em>académie</em>. Yet, despite being a
                  dissection illustration, the Walsh lacks the taut violence
                  that in Gericault is rarely far below the surface and which,
                  as in the mature Maclise, is sublimely erotic: desire, sex,
                  and death come together.

                  Similar in style to Walsh/Fairland, the later anatomical
                  lithographs Fairland produced for Francis Sibson’s (1814–1876)
                  <em>Medical Anatomy</em> (1869), deployed Sibson’s
                  idiosyncratic technical procedure for tracing his own
                  dissections, which were then lithographed by William Fairland.

                  This overly complex process, difficult to imagine in practice
                  (how such a tracing frame could be set up and worked on above
                  a corpse on a slab), is not known to have been widely adopted.
                  Inventive though it is, it suggests the mind of a pure
                  scientist complicating an otherwise direct transcription that
                  could be produced by any good artist, including Fairland
                  himself, but especially one like Joseph Maclise, who was also
                  a surgeon-anatomist. Crucially, in Sibson’s case, it enabled
                  the anatomist to retain full control, rather than conceding it
                  to Fairland’s skills.

                  The complete Quain text for
                  <em>The Anatomy of the Arteries of the Human Body</em> was,
                  according to its title-page, published in 1844, but Maclise’s
                  plates were printed in batches or “fascicules” beginning as
                  early as 1840, with an anticipated total of thirteen.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn93" id="fnref93">93</a></sup>
                  While there is no certainty over the extent to which Joseph
                  Maclise was directed or constrained by Quain, a mature Maclise
                  style emerged in the later plates, circa 1842–1844, when he
                  came closer in feel to the Walsh/Fairland plates. Thus, in
                  “Abdomen” (see <a href="#acallen-fig12">Fig.&nbsp;12</a>), Maclise
                  explored a far richer and more sensual use of the lithographic
                  chalk than seen in his earlier Quain plates. Here, to
                  differentiate the complex, richly detailed textures of the
                  organs, he exploits an extensive range of tonal values and
                  touch that are arguably best suited to this complex subject.
                  The cornucopia of bulging organs is animated by Maclise’s
                  densely worked detail in the central ellipse, brought into
                  “sculpted” relief under his left-to-right directional light
                  and rendered by his superbly varied hatched modelling.
                  Projecting into our space, this brilliant illusion of
                  three-dimensionality is cleverly reinforced by the surrounding
                  linear simplicity, where delicate black lines, stark in
                  contrast to the white paper, evoke the linen swaddling the
                  figure. Maclise drapes his white “cloth” theatrically over the
                  figure’s left hip, to create a striking cast shadow from his
                  well-endowed genitals, which hang pristine before his smoothly
                  carved loins to draw the spectator’s eye. The genitals are
                  beautifully rendered with contour hatch lines to echo and
                  sculpt its plump forms. A deeply shadowed fold of fabric
                  between his thighs is a metonymic device more commonly seen in
                  female erotica to suggest the vulva.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn94" id="fnref94">94</a></sup>
                  Clearly, by this date, Joseph Maclise’s style (as his
                  commentators were to observe) owed less to his English
                  contemporaries or the Bells than to Continental influences,
                  whether Gros, Gericault, Delacroix, or Nicolas-Henri Jacob (<a href="#acallen-fig23">Fig.&nbsp;23</a>). And yet, direct comparison between Jacob and Maclise
                  serves powerfully to demonstrate the painterly sensuality of
                  the latter, as against the static formal restraint of Jacob,
                  despite his “live” muscular figure. Maclise evidently looked
                  more to the theatrical drama, sensuality, and
                  <em>mouvementé</em> flamboyance of French Romantic art than to
                  Jacob’s colder Davidian manner.

                <p>
                  What we are witnessing here, I contend, is a stylistic
                  development, an ever-growing confidence and skill in Joseph
                  Maclise’s use of the lithographic medium, and with it a
                  parallel shift to “live” figures, probably inspired by his
                  work in Paris with Gerdy and his study of French art. In the
                  preface to his own 1851 <em>Surgical Anatomy</em>, Maclise
                  provides a clear scientific rationale to underpin this “new”
                  style which, addressed specifically to the trainee surgeon, is
                  after all intended as an aide to operating on
                  <em>live</em> subjects.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn95" id="fnref95">95</a></sup>
                  Superbly emotive in their lush build-up of chalk strokes,
                  producing a richly modelled effect, without loss of precision
                  in the detail, Maclise’s mature lithographs demonstrate an
                  extraordinary control of his drawing mediums. His first plates
                  for Quain, then, are less clearly personal: the scrawny
                  unidealised body in Plate 2, “Neck and thorax” (see
                  <a href="#acallen-fig22">Fig.&nbsp;22</a>) is stylistically closer
                  to the Bells, particularly to John Bell (see
                  <a href="#acallen-fig4">Fig. 4</a>). Maclise’s figure looks
                  very dead: a worn old man emaciated by a lifetime of hunger
                  and work, and typical of the actual corpses available for
                  dissection (see <a href="#acallen-fig2">Fig. 2</a>). Maclise
                  soon abandoned this abrasive Bellsian style. By Quain Plate 51
                  (see <a href="#acallen-fig12">Fig.&nbsp;12</a>), especially the
                  intestines, his complex lighting includes highlights,
                  reflected lights, and lustre to suggest moist malleability and
                  vitality, the very textures of the different organs. The
                  degree of Maclise’s obsession with precise observational
                  detail—or the <em>appearance</em> of it—is seen here in the
                  glistening entrails where even an overhead window is
                  apparently reflected. Another glossy bar of light cast on the
                  firmly straight (circumcised?) penis affirms its solid bulk,
                  its tantalising hint of tumescence.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn96" id="fnref96">96</a></sup>

                <p>
                  In Quain Plate 51, Joseph Maclise also exploits contrasts of
                  “finish” (see <a href="#acallen-fig12">Fig.&nbsp;12</a>). A
                  schematic left hand dissolves into drapery, in contrast to the
                  beautifully resolved right hand and muscular arm, held
                  effortlessly above the open and extravagantly baroque abdomen
                  by a delicate twist of bandage. These are not the hands of a
                  labourer or manual worker. In Maclise’s Plate 55 for Quain,
                  both arms are folded across the chest, and again hands play a
                  central role (<a href="#acallen-fig24">Fig.&nbsp;24</a>).
                  Unmistakably youthful, this figure is verging on puberty.
                  Although, echoing the subject matter, an oval format is common
                  for the trunk in artistic anatomies, here, distinctively for
                  Maclise, this beautiful boy-man is tenderly “framed” in an
                  encircling ellipse reminiscent of rococo portraiture—and
                  lithographic portraits. This figure has youthful genitals and
                  the palest “girlish” skin. Maclise is remarkable for his close
                  observational attention to skin texture and tone from a wide
                  range of ethnic origins and ages, which, thanks to his
                  extraordinary skills in life drawing and lithography, he is
                  able to represent so persuasively in black and white.
                  Combined, these qualities ensure the “truth” and legitimacy of
                  his images, convincing the viewer of a scientific authority
                  based in extensive comparative (human) anatomy, while
                  simultaneously delighting the voyeuristic eye.

                  Differentiating the <em>physiology</em> of the senses from
                  their <em>cultural</em> associations (if this is indeed
                  possible), Sander Gilman observes that “[t]o comprehend the
                  social construction of ‘touch’ and its relationship to
                  sexuality, we must take into consideration the fact that the
                  representation of touch is always in the realm of another
                  sense, that of sight”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn97" id="fnref97">97</a></sup>
                  Elaborating this idea, he argues:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Thus the status afforded sight and touch, most often
                    considered the highest and the lowest of the senses, is not
                    random. These two senses are inexorably linked within the
                    social construction of their history, just as they are
                    linked within the internalized construction of the erotic
                    gaze.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn98" id="fnref98">98</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Distinguishing the social construction of “good” and “bad”
                  touching, Gilman suggests that the touching of the self is a
                  “powerful homologue” for the touching of a same-sex Other—a
                  touch electrifyingly visible in Maclise’s surgical anatomies
                  where, in addition to penises, hands play a central role. In
                  the majority of his plates, neither appendage was strictly
                  necessary. Yet Maclise stressed in his preface regarding (and
                  justifying) his “novel treatment” of anatomical figures for
                  the surgeon, like the dashingly vigorous model in “location of
                  the viscera” (see <a href="#acallen-fig16">Fig.&nbsp;16</a>): “I
                  have […] <em>left appended</em> to the dissected regions as
                  much of the undissected as was necessary”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn99" id="fnref99">99</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a series of dissections of the groin on standing figures,
                  Maclise first presents a single exquisite model. Quite
                  gratuitously overexposed from the ribcage to below the right
                  knee (see <a href="#acallen-fig11">Fig. 11</a>), he empowers
                  this model with a more confident homoerotic self-display and
                  panache than can be found even in dedicated “artistic nudes”,
                  like Émile Bayard’s (1868–1937) photographic “Nus masculins”
                  in <em>Le Nu esthétique</em> or those of Wilhelm von Gloeden
                  (1856–1931) (<a href="#acallen-fig25">Fig.&nbsp;25</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn100" id="fnref100">100</a></sup>
                  In Maclise’s plate, the figure’s right leg takes the body
                  weight, while the left is raised to the side, knee bent, the
                  better to expose the dissected groin. This is a bronzed
                  Athenian god of a figure, his superb athletic form and firm
                  flesh smoothly rendered, muscles catching a light angled to
                  accentuate their perfection. Hairless almost throughout, in
                  the manner of a scraped Greek athlete, like Lysippos’
                  <em>Apoxyomenos</em>, this trope makes explicit reference to
                  Hellenic homosexual culture, or the modern Turkish bath, to a
                  knowing Victorian male audience (<a href="#acallen-fig26">Fig.&nbsp;26</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn101" id="fnref101">101</a></sup>
                  Maclise marks a modern masculinity in discreetly drawing
                  attention to his model’s testicles, where minutely observed
                  pubic hairs stand out against the white of the paper. The
                  model’s hand introduced here in Plate 16 (1851) (see
                  <a href="#acallen-fig11">Fig.&nbsp;11</a>), if more “work-reddened”
                  and meaty than that for his Quain Plate 51 (see
                  <a href="#acallen-fig12">Fig.&nbsp;12</a>), is again eloquent,
                  evoking the sense of touch and of self-touching between the
                  index and second fingers and again on his thigh.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn102" id="fnref102">102</a></sup>
                  This immediately recalls Gerdy and his artist Maximilien-Félix
                  Demesse, whose Plate 3 has the same hand, the same touch (<a href="#acallen-fig27">Fig. 27</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn103" id="fnref103">103</a></sup>
                  The fact that the figure holds a ball in his hand (cue
                  “athlete”) is barely perceptible in this plate (compare with
                  Gerdy’s diagram and Plate 1,
                  <a href="#acallen-fig15">Figs. 15</a> and
                  <a href="#acallen-fig17">17</a>). Instead, the eye lingers
                  over whether his finger and thumb touch, or do not touch, the
                  flank of his own buttock. Maclise undoubtedly knew Gerdy’s
                  <em>Anatomie des peintres</em>, and he probably knew Demesse
                  himself.

                <p>
                  In Plate 26 of Maclise’s <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> (1856
                  London edition), this figure is transformed, reproduced
                  landscape on the sheet, cut off at upper thigh; yet, the
                  eloquent hand remains, as do the tiny pubic hairs on the
                  scrotum, along with new anatomical detail: on his right thigh,
                  Maclise provides the surface appearance of the femoral vessels
                  dissected on the left leg. The model’s full vertical splendour
                  returns in Plate 48 (1856; see also Plate 47 in the 1851
                  edition): the same pose but with hand and drapery omitted (<a href="#acallen-fig28">Fig.&nbsp;28</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn104" id="fnref104">104</a></sup>
                  Instead, there are other, different <em>frissons</em>. A
                  hanging slab of muscle echoes the angle and dangle of the
                  penis; the bent left leg is restrained below the calf, for
                  once the rope shown digging into flesh, tautly tied for no
                  apparent reason and to nowhere we can see. On this leg, the
                  indication of surface veins below the skin continues beyond
                  the dissection on to the thigh and calf; yet only on a live
                  body in which blood is circulating would such raised veins or
                  arteries be expected to occur. On both sides of the ligature
                  restricting the femoral vein in the dissection itself, there
                  is a lumpy swelling of its “contents” (despite nearby vessels
                  being severed); the similar “tourniquet” roping of the calf
                  would arguably result in a swelling above it of the arteries
                  rather than the veins in a living subject.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn105" id="fnref105">105</a></sup>
                  This olive-skinned flesh characteristic of the preferred
                  Italian artists’ models of the period also sports a suture to
                  the right leg. Seen first on the inner thigh of the Black man
                  (1851) (<a href="#acallen-fig29">Fig.&nbsp;29</a>) and later
                  recurring sutured, here the sutured incision is replicated on
                  a “white” man. Highly evocative/provocative and exquisitely
                  drawn, the thread of this apparently subcutaneous suture is
                  left hanging from the sewn wound, casting its own delicate
                  shadow.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn106" id="fnref106">106</a></sup>
                  Pleasure and pain again: secret cuts and scars give
                  authenticity and human frailty to perfect beauty.

                  Maclise’s Plate 18 in <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> (1851)
                  extended this theme into coupledom (<a href="#acallen-fig30">Fig. 30</a>). Close-cropped, he focuses in on a series of groins of two
                  overlapping figures. Almost line dancers in a cabaret or an
                  anatomical striptease, each dissection reveals deeper and
                  different layers of component organs, the veins and arteries
                  picked out in watercolour. And, of course, the acutely
                  observed and distinct genitals: all different, each carefully
                  delineated. Thus, posed alike, these two, well-built males
                  contrast: on our right, a mature manly physique, darker
                  skinned with a hint of ageing flesh on the muscle; on our
                  left, narrow-hipped and lithe, a firm-bodied young blood. The
                  older figure pushes up against the younger, his genitals
                  suggestively touching the thigh of the younger model. In
                  Maclise’s 1856 London second edition, with its smaller sheets
                  (52&nbsp;x&nbsp;34&nbsp;cm), the two figures are reduced and slightly cropped
                  in two successive landscape sheets showing the incrementally
                  deeper dissections (Plates 27 and 28). Two further plates of
                  paired groins illustrate inguinal hernias, the figures placed
                  side by side, not touching (Plates 29 and 30).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn107" id="fnref107">107</a></sup>
                  There seems here in Maclise no intimation of, no concession
                  to, the rising public anxieties at this period over moral
                  probity, where even medical images might be subject to
                  censure; this resulted, in 1857, in the Obscene Publications
                  Act that sought to define and police the immoral power of the
                  libidinous gaze.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn108" id="fnref108">108</a></sup>

                  Lithography oiled the wheels of dissemination. And of course,
                  unlike an incised or intaglio medium, lithographs can be
                  almost indefinitely reprinted from the original stone without
                  wearing out, or rather wearing <em>down</em>, as happens—with
                  an attendant loss of definition—in etched or engraved
                  printing; hence, this planographic method is quite distinct,
                  more economic, and direct. Lithography depends upon the oily
                  printing ink adhering only to the areas of the stone marked by
                  the artist’s design in waxy lithographic crayon, giving
                  effects like chalk or pastel, or with “tusche”—the liquid waxy
                  variant which can be applied with pen or brush—to achieve a
                  distinctively ink or watercolour effect.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn109" id="fnref109">109</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Maclise principally uses the lithographic crayon, mirroring
                  the effect of black chalk drawing. Marking his professional
                  terrains in his lithographs for Quain, Maclise advertises his
                  skills as both artist and surgeon-anatomist, self-consciously
                  positioning exquisite still lifes of his tools alongside the
                  dissections. His draughtsman’s tools: a roll of paper, a
                  <em>porte-crayon</em>, knife, quill pen, and a bottle of ink
                  (or lithographic tusche), lie at the foot of a dissected leg
                  in Plate 72 (circa 1844) (<a href="#acallen-fig31">Fig.&nbsp;31</a>). In the lateral dissection of a female bladder and
                  reproductive organs, Plate 59 (circa 1842–1843) (<a href="#acallen-fig32">Fig.&nbsp;32</a>), Maclise’s curved surgical scissors (a feminine tool?)
                  eloquently reinforce the curve of a smooth-fleshed buttock, so
                  plumply rounded it appears not to be load-bearing. In a second
                  lateral dissection (male), Plate 60, a phallic
                  <em>porte-crayon</em> awaits the cadaver’s hand (<a href="#acallen-fig33">Fig.&nbsp;33</a>). A disembodied hand in Quain, Plate 43 (<a href="#acallen-fig34">Fig.&nbsp;34</a>; see also <a href="#acallen-fig35">Fig.&nbsp;35</a>, which shows
                  the <em>porte-crayon</em> among the essential tools of the
                  lithographer), gestures eloquently to the interlocked tools of
                  the artist-anatomist: a loaded <em>porte-crayon</em> rests on
                  tweezers and a small blade or scalpel. In Plate 44, the
                  “corpse’s” hand is wittily poised beside the
                  surgeon-anatomist’s threaded curved needle, a specialist
                  wood-handled flesh-hook and probe(?). For Maclise, all the
                  tools of his trades included in his lithographs served as
                  reminders both of the expert human touch of the specialist
                  entailed in&nbsp;this multilayered work, and of the work’s
                  “objective” scientific basis in observation; it was, as
                  William Hunter named it, the “mark of truth”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn110" id="fnref110">110</a></sup>
                  It is for Maclise, when working under Quain’s direction,
                  simultaneously the young artist-surgeon’s calling card;
                  indeed, in Plate 43, the tools appear immediately above the
                  artist’s signature (see <a href="#acallen-fig34">Fig.&nbsp;34</a>).
                  Yet, equally, in his play on tools and cadavers, Maclise is
                  making macabre visual puns that border on the knowing
                  dissection-room prank: in-jokes which, to the
                  <em>aficionados</em> of anatomy were a key feature of this
                  “rite of passage”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn111" id="fnref111">111</a></sup>
                  By the time of Joseph Maclise’s solo publications, especially
                  the major <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> (1851), his skills were
                  famous: with his own authority stamped on the title-page,
                  there was no longer the need to publicise his dual
                  expertise.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn112" id="fnref112">112</a></sup>

                  Indeed, Quain could be a patronising patron. In the 1844
                  preface to his atlas,
                  <em>The Anatomy of the Arteries of the Human Body</em>, Quain
                  noted with clinical understatement that although his friend
                  and associate Joseph Maclise was first and foremost an
                  “anatomist and surgeon”, his (eighty-seven plates of)
                  “drawings will, I believe, be found not have lost in spirit
                  and effect” as a result. The lithographs were initially
                  available in seventeen unbound fascicules produced between
                  1840 (when on 19 December the first issue was reviewed in the
                  <em>Provincial Medical &amp; Surgical Journal</em>) and 1846,
                  when a subscription appeal for five hundred bound volumes
                  appeared in <em>The Lancet</em> on 31 October.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn113" id="fnref113">113</a></sup>
                  Quain emphasised his requirement that Maclise “carry out my
                  views as to the delineations”: his lithographs were to follow
                  Quain’s directions. The atlas’s title-page clearly specifies
                  what Maclise undertook: “The Drawings from Nature and on Stone
                  by Joseph Maclise Esq. Surgeon”—not only did he make the
                  initial anatomical drawings, we are told he also drew them on
                  the lithographic stone.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn114" id="fnref114">114</a></sup>
                  This work was more typically undertaken by
                  draughtsmen-designers employed by the lithographic printers,
                  usually overseen by the original artist and/or the
                  anatomist-surgeon. Yet evidently, in Maclise’s case, his
                  desire for authority and the integrity of the work meant he
                  drew the stones himself, and his style is highly
                  characteristic throughout his illustrations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn115" id="fnref115">115</a></sup>
                  The effort was certainly worth his while. For the 1840
                  reviewer, Joseph Maclise “evinced artistical talent of the
                  very highest order”; “brother to the famous painter of that
                  name”, Joseph’s lithographs “completely overshadowed” Quain’s
                  confused text. Significantly given Joseph Maclise’s Paris
                  <em>stage</em> and artistic interests, his lithographs “bear
                  comparison with any of those splendid specimens of anatomical
                  drawing, so abundant on the continent but … so rare in our own
                  country”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn116" id="fnref116">116</a></sup>
                  The reviewer was doubtless alert to the outstanding
                  contemporary work of Jacob in Paris for Jean-Baptiste-Marc
                  Bourgery’s (1797–1849)
                  <em>Traité complet de l’anatomie de l’homme comprenant la
                    médecine opératoire</em>
                  (1831–1854), already in production when Maclise was living
                  there.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn117" id="fnref117">117</a></sup>
                  The 1846 Taylor &amp; Walton subscription to Quain’s
                  <em>The Anatomy of the Arteries of the Human Body</em> also
                  offered the entire run of the then “eighty-seven drawings” in
                  unbound portfolio form: in imperial folio, “an oblong,
                  averaging about two feet square, the figures thus being the
                  size of life”. The publishers stressed that “the large size of
                  the stones renders it difficult to preserve them uninjured …”
                  thus,
                </p>

                    they design to print off as many copies as are wanted by

                    stones, in order that the plates may not be hereafter
                    produced in a less perfect manner, or the pecuniary value of
                    the work to the purchaser be lessened by a subsequent
                    flooding of the market with an indefinite number of copies,
                    worn or not.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn118" id="fnref118">118</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Equally, however, it is clear when comparing prints from
                  different editions of Maclise’s <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> that
                  there are subtle variations in interpretation when a stone was
                  redrawn, and re-sized, not necessarily by Maclise himself. The
                  Philadelphia editions, in a much weaker hand, were copied onto
                  stone in America.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn119" id="fnref119">119</a></sup>
                  Abstracted stylisation accretes too through repetition from
                  the flat, where knowledge and sight of the original is lost.
                  There are slight differences, for example, in the twist of the
                  torso and the muscular detail in the dissection figures of
                  “Thorax and abdomen” between the 1851 and 1856 editions
                  (Plates 12 and 22, respectively); more thigh is visible in the
                  1851 print while, in the 1856 print, the contrasts of light
                  and shade in the modelling are more pronounced.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn120" id="fnref120">120</a></sup>
                  Differences are particularly clear in comparing the drawings
                  of a Black man’s head in the 1851 and 1856 London editions (<a href="#acallen-fig36">Figs. 36</a>
                  and <a href="#acallen-fig37">37</a>). Whereas the two “white”
                  heads in this comparative anatomy sheet are relatively
                  similar, differing just in subtle physiognomic details and in
                  1856 a reduced light–dark contrast, the treatment of the two
                  Black men’s heads—notably in the handling of the hair, but
                  also in the appearance of the skin—suggests the later
                  draughtsman had no personal knowledge of Black people. In the
                  1851 print, the intense light-absorbing properties of a matt
                  blue-black skin, and the tightly curled hair are beautifully
                  evoked but, in the 1856 print, not only is the head
                  physiognomically more brutish but also the hair is rendered
                  like burnished, light-reflective bronze studs, or a scaly
                  helmet—an effect heightened by the raking overhead light that
                  also gives areas of skin a glistening sheen more common on
                  Maclise’s white flesh. It is probable these lithographs in the
                  second London edition (1856) were drawn directly on stone—not
                  by Maclise himself but by expert “copyists”.

                  Whether as a naturalistic “mark of truth”, a sentimental
                  gesture of shared humanity, or an erotic sign, Joseph’s
                  inclusion of the earring hole, too, meticulously denoted in
                  the lobe of his Black model (<a href="#acallen-fig38">Fig.&nbsp;38</a>) is equally a signifier of the man’s social status and
                  profession: in London at this period, most Black men were
                  freed or escaped slaves employed mainly as sailors, and
                  earrings were associated with this profession.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn121" id="fnref121">121</a></sup>
                  Commonly a captain’s gift to a young sailor on first crossing
                  the equator or rounding Cape Horn, the gold hoop was both a
                  talisman against drowning (among other things), and a bond to
                  cover a dead sailor’s transport home and funeral.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn122" id="fnref122">122</a></sup>
                  There is thus a narrative eloquence here to the Black man’s
                  empty earring hole, and tragic irony in his “appearance” on
                  the dissection slab. The bodies available for medical
                  dissection might as often be female as male, and yet in visual
                  representation the “Body” was essentially male. Significantly
                  with respect to the racialised body (and this is apparent in
                  Maclise’s anatomies, see
                  <a href="#acallen-fig29">Figs. 29</a>,
                  <a href="#acallen-fig36">36</a>,
                  <a href="#acallen-fig37">37</a>, and
                  <a href="#acallen-fig38">38</a>) and despite the contentions
                  of some comparative anatomists and proto-anthropologists,
                  dissection prompted others to question theories of an embodied
                  racial difference precisely because beneath differently
                  pigmented skins the same flesh and corporeal structures were
                  present.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn123" id="fnref123">123</a></sup>
                  In Europe, the appearance of Black people or “outsiders” like
                  Jews in anatomical atlases and painting alike might suggest a
                  negatively racialised interest in comparative anatomy, yet
                  perhaps paradoxically can equally signal the work of radicals:
                  abolitionists, non-conformists, and liberal thinkers like
                  Gericault, William Etty (1787–1849), and Joseph Maclise
                  himself.

                <p>
                  Just as in the burgeoning series of “aesthetic nude”
                  photographs notionally intended for artists’ use, or the
                  artistic studies of beautiful well-hung Sicilian youths posed
                  by photographers like Baron Wilhelm von Gloeden (see
                  <a href="#acallen-fig25">Fig.&nbsp;25</a>) forty-odd years later,
                  in his <em>Surgical Anatomy</em>, Joseph Maclise left
                  particular parts more exposed than others—notably, as we have
                  seen, hands and the male external genitalia.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn124" id="fnref124">124</a></sup>
                  The viewer’s eye is inexorably drawn in particular to his
                  penises, their sheer variety and myriad beauty, their personal
                  portrait-like individuality. Given his large-scale, almost
                  life-size figure plates, their impact is all the greater.
                  Verging on the obsessional, every conceivable shape and state
                  of vigorous male genitalia—apart from erect—are lovingly
                  delineated, providing his readership with a veritable taxonomy
                  of healthy sexual organs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn125" id="fnref125">125</a></sup>
                  Indeed, visibly more full-blooded and generous than those
                  found on neoclassical nudes, Maclise’s penises were barely
                  constrained by the bounds of Victorian propriety and
                  convention. Although recognised as “high art” and as skilful
                  as those of his brother Daniel, arguably Joseph’s naked male
                  figures could <em>only</em> be accommodated within the
                  homosocial world of medicine.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn126" id="fnref126">126</a></sup>
                  Unmistakably erotic in feel as in sheer penis count, genitals
                  are often the central focus between assertively splayed thighs
                  or “man-spread”. Far from evoking death, Maclise’s life-size
                  male figures <em>embody</em> vital manly virility, the
                  “absent” erect penis displaced in the muscular verticality of
                  his models’ superbly taut polished flesh: the rippling
                  athletic thighs, arms, shoulders and, indeed, in the eloquent
                  hands.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn127" id="fnref127">127</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The particular advantages of the lithographic medium, its
                  expressive qualities, and approximation to the intimacy of
                  chalk drawing, plus the wealth of rich texture and detail it
                  offered to such a consummate draughtsman, its subtle direct
                  and indirect lights, reflections and shadows both attached and
                  cast, result in an extraordinary variety of sensual, erotic
                  delights for the libidinous eye. Paraphrasing Michael Hatt’s
                  analysis of Haymo Thornycroft’s rural <em>Mower</em>,
                  Maclise’s well-endowed, urban guardsmen, sailors, and
                  labouring bodies have a kind of masculine muscle that could be
                  looked at and enjoyed overtly in a medico-anatomical
                  narrative, and also as “phantasmatic figure[s] to be consumed
                  covertly in an erotic one; the very process of looking, of
                  contemplation, is one which submerges this paradox”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn128" id="fnref128">128</a></sup>
                  Given the medical context and function of Maclise’s
                  lithographs, their artistic quality and scale demonstrate the
                  artist’s own pleasure in the male body, a pleasure with a more
                  than chance resemblance to pictorial homoerotic
                  pornography—and similarly a resistance to normative Victorian
                  heterosexuality. Yet, covert erotic looking in the domain of
                  the anatomy room, or the private library, is a very different
                  affair to that in a public art gallery or Westminster Halls.
                  According to the Obscene Publications Act of 1857, it was not
                  possession as such of erotica that was considered dangerous
                  but rather its uncontrolled production and dissemination among
                  the ill-educated masses, threatening to distract and weaken
                  workers, and corrupt the innocence of youth. Working privately
                  from live rather than dead models, Maclise could sate his own
                  homoerotic desires (whether lived out or phantasmic) for the
                  male military body: a passion he shared with his brother
                  Daniel. Creating medical anatomies at such a high level of
                  aesthetic skill meant Joseph Maclise observed and drew the
                  best male models as a fine artist, while at the same time
                  being licensed as a surgeon-anatomist to explore intimate
                  bodily terrains forbidden to Daniel as a painter of heroic
                  military history.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Like their anatomical artists, such lithographic plates
                  travelled widely. Their relative cheapness—especially in
                  individual fascicules of a few plates—meant that, like
                  pornography, they were readily available and doubtless
                  circulated within educated circles well beyond their primary
                  audience of medical students and surgeons. Under the umbrella
                  of medical science, these superb lithographs offered their
                  all-male viewers, whether in London or Paris, Boston or
                  Philadelphia, a safe space to enjoy their libidinous gaze on
                  exquisite male bodies, modern ideals of athletic masculinity,
                  without fear of persecution or censure.

                        Daniel’s life and painting career are well documented,

                        direct reference to Charles Bell in Joseph Maclise’s
                        Plate 66 for Quain. A book by ‘C Bell’ lies beneath a
                        section of pelvis displaying the blood vessels that
                        nourish the penis; it is unclear if this is intended as
                        a compliment or is a ribald University College in-joke.

                        two years, probably 1839–1841, given the 900 plus bodies

                        Charles Bell’s tenure at University College was brief:
                        he resigned after only one year due to disagreements
                        with its radical reformers. Bell had begun his
                        professional association with Middlesex Hospital in 1814
                        as a surgeon and, in 1835, was instrumental in the
                        foundation of its new Middlesex Hospital Medical School.
                        On radical reformers, see Adrian Desmond,
                        <em>The Politics of Evolution: Morphology, Medicine, and
                          Reform in Radical London</em>
                        (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1992), who
                        includes Joseph Maclise among these. Charles Bell, a
                        “soft” or conservative reformer, was hostile to radical
                        French anatomy; see Desmond’s annotated “Biographical
                        List of British Medical Men”, in
                        <em>The Politics of Evolution</em>, 417–418 and 425. See
                        also Carin Berkowitz, who notes that Charles Bell’s
                        politics were shaped by the exigencies of developing a
                        living through patronage in a time when careers in
                        medicine simply did not exist; see her overview in

                        (both Bells eschewed Latin terminology); his preface
                        also stresses the vital importance of anatomical
                        knowledge of the arteries in surgery. In the at times
                        vitriolic preface to his
                        <em>Engravings Explaining the Anatomy of the Bones,
                          Muscles and Joints</em>
                        (1804), John Bell criticised the hubris and impractical
                        lack of necessity he found in earlier life-sized
                        anatomical prints, seeking himself to create in both
                        scale and utility an educative unity between image and
                        text (iii–iv), and similarly the frequent reuse of
                        outdated and badly mangled historical images like those
                        of Vesalius, to illustrate new texts (iv–v). Bell also
                        contrasted the educational needs in anatomical
                        instruction of artists as against surgeons; see Bell,
                        <em>Engravings Explaining the Anatomy of the Bones,
                          Muscles and Joints</em>
                        (1804), xiii–xv. I concur with Martin Kemp’s contention
                        that there is no such thing as “style-less” anatomical
                        illustration, see Kemp, “Style and Non-Style in
                        Anatomical Illustration”, 192; his analysis of Bell’s
                        Preface, is excellent, Kemp, “Style and Non-Style in
                        Anatomical Illustration”, 193–196.

                        were two Richard Quains, cousins: Sir Richard Quain
                        (1816–1898) became a prominent London physician; he
                        trained at University College during the same period as
                        Joseph Maclise and moved in the same circle of friends

                        The National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, records the
                        debate over the spelling of Gericault’s name without the
                        accented “e” and chose to follow this style, as do I:
                        “In contrast to traditional and very recent sources,
                        this spelling follows Philippe Grunchec and his
                        adherents […] The origin of the word is reportedly the
                        river Ger in his native Normandy; family documents
                        exclude the accent; and Gericault regularly signed his
                        name without”. See Philippe Grunchec,

                        While in London Gericault produced a suite of twelve
                        lithographs with a frontispiece of uncompromising London
                        scenes, mainly its lowlife, printed by C. Hullmandel’s

                        A hard and menial task, the stone was differently
                        prepared for either ink or chalk by an apprentice
                        lithographer: while the stone surface for ink required
                        polishing, that for drawing needed a “grain” for chalk
                        to adhere. See Twyman, <em>Lithography 1800–1850</em>,
                        115–116; he notes that Engelmann’s
                        <em>Manuel du dessinateur lithographe</em> (Paris,
                        1822), was technically the most detailed and best of
                        those available, as well as the first to appear in
                        print, <em>Lithography 1800–1850</em>, 114. Twyman
                        stresses that becoming expert in lithography was not
                        entirely simple; see his <em>Lithography 1800–1850</em>,
                        Chapter 9.

                        effectiveness of early lithography versus copper
                        engraved plates, <em>Lithography 1800–1850</em>, 113;

                        reproductive printmaking, obviously the original image
                        had to be reversed on the plate to print in the correct

                        of Gericault’s nude, foreground left, altering the
                        original perhaps to accommodate the sensibilities of a
                        British public. Mezzotint was deemed a very British
                        method of printing in post-Revolutionary France, where
                        lithography instead gradually gained ground, especially
                        for reproductive printmaking and among radical younger

                        included in medical books published in 1840–1842. He
                        states: “At the end of the project [1844?], Taylor &amp;

                        Schupbach with the author. However, the series took
                        longer to produce, since the complete volume appeared
                        <em>after</em> the 1844 title-page date, apparently in
                        1846: see n. 111, below. Maclise’s 1851
                        <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> was also published in
                        fascicules: the first early in 1849, in the
                        <em>Provincial Medical &amp; Surgical Journal</em> 13,
                        no. 3 (7 February 1849): 84; and the fifth, on inguinal

                        the human figure is as a map to the surgeon, explanatory
                        of the anatomy arranged beneath; and I have therefore

                        undissected as was necessary. My object was to indicate
                        the interior through the superficies, and thereby
                        illustrate the whole living body which concerns surgery,
                        through its dissected dead counterfeit. We dissect the
                        dead animal body in order to furnish the memory with as
                        clear an account of the structure contained in its
                        living representative, which we are not allowed to
                        analyse, as if this latter were
                        <em>perfectly translucent</em>, and directly

                        mid-century, circumcision was increasingly debated as a
                        hygienic measure to counter the spread of venereal
                        diseases, and also as a means to curtail sexual pleasure
                        and hence masturbation in young men.

                        (see Fig.&nbsp;15) is an excellent expression of Maclise’s
                        notion of corporeal “transparency”, preface to

                        demonstrate for the surgeon the subcutaneous location of
                        the veins. It was not uncommon to inject the veins and

                        their visibility in dissection; Charles Bell gave

                        His numbering of the parts is intentionally very
                        discreet to avoid spoiling the images’ aesthetic
                        qualities. Continental and especially Italian models

                        Maclise appears less comfortable depicting heterosexual
                        couplings, giving very different examples in both his
                        1851 and 1856 London atlases: the former (larger) plates
                        position the figures side by side, the female with her
                        back to the male, without any overlap or touching; in
                        the reworked 1856 Plate 10, they overlap, the male
                        turning his back on the athletic-looking female,
                        obscuring her face, and casting his shadow over her
                        breast, but still nowhere touching. In Blanchard and
                        Lea’s 1851 Philadelphia edition (with locally redrawn
                        plates), the male and female are allotted separate
                        sheets/separate spheres (Plates 13 and 14).

                        As Meredith Drew argues: “In the years immediately
                        preceding the Obscene Publications Act of 1857 that
                        defined the category of ‘pornography’, anatomical
                        illustration was being purged of sexual connotations as
                        part of an attempt to consolidate medicine as a
                        respectable profession […] In the eyes of this new
                        professional body, there was no space for sexual
                        associations in anatomical texts”; see Meredith Drew,

                          Demonstrate the Archetype Skeleton of Vertebrated
                          Animals</em>; however, its lithographic illustrations were simpler
                        and more strictly functional, prioritising skeletal/bone
                        fragments.

                        While this is true for his whole-plate figures, a good
                        deal of Maclise’s <em>Surgical Anatomy</em> treats
                        diseased/deformed male external genitalia, each

                        them; likewise the male anus appears in uncompromising
                        lithographic images where the whole figure is tied up in
